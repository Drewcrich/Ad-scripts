Title: Game-Style “Simulate a Fishing Trip”

## Overview

This concept presents PrimeBite’s value as a **game-like simulation**, not a literal fishing video.  
The viewer watches a stylized lake or ocean, a tiny boat icon, and fish icons reacting as time changes – like a fishing strategy game.

## Objectives

- Make PrimeBite feel like a “cheat code” for timing in a way that’s fun and visual.  
- Show, not tell, what happens when you fish **with** vs **without** PrimeBite timing.  
- Make everything obviously game/animated so there is no confusion with real-world footage.

## Visual Style & Tone

- **Style:** Simple, game-like graphics.
  - Top-down or isometric view of a lake/ocean.  
  - Tiny boat icon, animated ripples, simple fish silhouettes below.  
  - Time-of-day indicator sliding along the top of the screen.
- **Tone:** Light, strategic, “you’re playing a fishing sim.”  
- **Color:** Clear contrast between “dead” hours and “hot” hours (e.g., greys vs bright greens/blues).  
- **UI Layer:** PrimeBite timeline and bite windows appear as overlays, connecting the “game” to real data.

## Narrative Patterns

1. **“Same Spot, Different Time”**
   - Scene 1: Slider moves across non-PrimeBite hours, few or no fish icons near the boat.  
   - Scene 2: Slider hits a PrimeBite major window; suddenly, more fish icons cluster around.  
   - Text: “Same lake. Same spot. Different time.”

2. **“Guessing vs PrimeBite Run”**
   - Split screen:
     - Left: “Guessing” – boat moves randomly, fish encounters rare.  
     - Right: “PrimeBite timing” – boat heads out only when the window opens, fish icons spike.
   - Overlaid Today Tab card highlights the actual window.

3. **“Fair Day Strategy Mode”**
   - Starting screen: “Today: 2.4/5 Fair.”  
   - Simulation fast-forwards a day; you only get a short window of dense fish icons.  
   - Message: “On fair days, windows are smaller. Don’t miss them.”

## Sora 2 Implementation Notes

- **Format:** 10–15 second vertical clips.  
- **Prompt style (high level):**
  - “Vertical animated game-style scene of a lake with a small boat icon and fish icons, clearly not realistic footage.”  
  - “Show a time-of-day slider at the top and fish icons moving in and out as time passes.”  
  - “Include on-screen labels and arrows connecting PrimeBite’s bite windows to spikes in fish activity.”  
  - “No realistic humans or camera footage – only animated icons and UI.”
- **Screenshot usage:**
  - Today Tab card: used to label the best windows on the slider.  
  - 24-hour activity timeline: used as a mini-map of “activity over time” under or beside the game scene.

## Messaging Pillars

- “Timing is a lever you can actually control.”  
- “PrimeBite turns ‘maybe’ into ‘right now’.”  
- “Most anglers pick where. PrimeBite helps you pick **when**.”

## Example Hook Angles (Not Full Scripts)

- “Watch what happens when you run this lake at random vs on the window.”  
- “Here’s how a ‘fair’ day actually plays out if you miss the only good window.”  
- “If PrimeBite was a game, this is the level you’d want to play.”

## Measurement & Testing Ideas

- Track:
  - Shares (game-like visuals can be more “fun” to share).  
  - Saves from people wanting to revisit the explanation.  
  - Comment quality (“this actually explains it,” “this is how I wish my sonar worked”).
- Compare:
  - Game-style clips vs blueprint-style vs phone POV for educational clarity and engagement.

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Risk:** Some viewers might take “game” too literally and think the app is a game.
  - Mitigation: Clear on-screen labeling: “Simulation of real bite data from PrimeBite.”  
- **Risk:** Overly cute style might undersell the seriousness of the product.
  - Mitigation: Keep voiceover and captions grounded and factual, even if visuals are playful.

## Variations to Explore Later

- Offshore vs freshwater maps with different fish icons.  
- “Scenario mode”: different weather or moon phases as “level modifiers” changing fish behavior.  
- Side-by-side simulations: walleye vs bass vs pike on the same day/time, different activity curves.
