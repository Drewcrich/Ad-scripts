- **Key element:** Emotional journey from frustration to success
- **Length:** Two clips stitched (before → after)

### Script 007 Pattern: Epic Moment Celebration

## Performance Insights

### What Works
1. **Educational/Tip-based content** - Highest engagement (Scripts 004, 005)
2. **Visual proof** - Fish shots create immediate credibility
3. **Relatable problems** - Viewers connect with frustration and solutions
4. **Specific timing references** - "Hit at 6:15 AM, exactly when the window said" builds trust

### What to Avoid
1. **Overly promotional tone** - Keep it content-first, not ad-like
2. **Before/after narratives without strong hook** - Can underperform if hook is weak
3. **Too many people in frame** - Keep crowds to 2-3 people max for natural feel

---

## AI Transparency Strategy

**Important:** These videos are AI-generated but designed to look like authentic UGC. Viewer comments about AI are expected and should be addressed transparently.

### In-Video Acknowledgment (Optional)
- For some videos, include brief AI acknowledgment in voiceover
- Should feel natural and conversational, not defensive
- Emphasize that PrimeBite app and data are real
- Example: "Oh, and just so you know—we use AI to make these videos, but the PrimeBite app? That's 100% real. The bite times actually work, and it's all research-backed data."

### When to Include
- Use sparingly (maybe 1 in 3-4 videos)
- Best for longer videos or final clips where there's natural space
- Should feel conversational, not forced

### Comment Response Strategy
- Reply authentically to AI-related comments
- Emphasize real PrimeBite data and research
- Keep it friendly and redirect to value

## Script Creation Guidelines

### Character Consistency
- Create character in first clip of multi-clip videos
- Reference same character for subsequent clips when narrative requires it
- Not all multi-clip videos need same character—use judgment based on story

### Multi-Clip Strategy
- Flexible: 1, 2, 3, 4+ clips stitched together
- Each clip: 10s or 15s (or 20s for longer explanations)
- Character consistency only when intentional for narrative
- Test different clip counts to find optimal engagement

### Prompt Structure
1. Start with format: "Vertical selfie video filmed on a phone"
2. Character description: "Mid-20s to mid-30s fisherman wearing hoodie and beanie"
3. Setting: Location and time of day
4. UGC markers: "Should feel like real TikTok UGC: slight phone shake, natural lighting, phone-mic audio"
5. Dialogue: Specific lines in quotes with delivery tone
6. Ambient sounds: Water, boat, room, crowd reactions
7. Overlay space: "Leave clean space in top-right corner"

### What NOT to Include
- Over-detailed visual descriptions (let Sora fill in naturally)
- Complex coordinated actions
- Fish in water (keep fish on deck, on ice, or being held)
- Large crowds (max 2-3 background people)

---

## Species & Setting Flexibility

### Freshwater (Walleye, Bass, Pike)
- Close-up fish holds work well
- Night scenes with headlamps
- Solo or small group (2-3 people)
- Lake/boat settings

### Offshore (Mahi-Mahi, Tuna, etc.)
- Fish shown on deck or being held
- Charter boat settings
- Multiple people (2-3 max for natural feel)
- High-energy, celebratory moments
- Avoid fish in water entirely

---

## Future Variations

### Potential Expansions
1. **Different species** - Expand beyond walleye and mahi-mahi
2. **Seasonal content** - Adapt to different fishing seasons
3. **Problem-solution formats** - Refine before/after approach
4. **Community-driven content** - Respond to comments/questions
5. **Different energy levels** - Test calm educational vs. high-energy celebration
6. **Setting diversity** - Dock, shore, different times of day

### Testing Opportunities
1. **Video length** - Test 10s vs 15s vs 20s individual clips
2. **Clip count** - Test 1, 2, 3, 4+ clips stitched together
3. **Hook variations** - A/B test different opening lines
4. **AI acknowledgment frequency** - Test with vs. without acknowledgment
