Title: Animated Data-World Explainers (No Real People)

## Overview

This concept turns PrimeBite’s data into its own animated “world,” removing realistic humans and cameras entirely.  
The videos lean into motion-graphics and abstract visuals so it’s 100% obvious that viewers are watching an AI/animated explainer, not a real fishing trip.

## Objectives

- Clearly communicate **what PrimeBite does** (bite windows, ratings, timing, activity patterns).  
- Make the **data itself the “hero”** instead of a person talking to camera.  
- Be visually distinct from typical fishing TikToks to avoid any sense of deception.  
- Stay short, punchy, and optimized for Shorts/Reels/TikTok (10–15s clips, stitchable).

## Visual Style & Tone

- **Style:** Minimalist 2D/3D data visualizations.
  - Simple boat icons, lake outlines, fish silhouettes.
  - Glowing lines/arcs showing bite windows and activity peaks.
  - Smooth camera moves around charts and graphs.
- **Tone:** Clean, modern, “techy,” but still approachable to everyday anglers.
- **Color:** Use brand-aligned colors (PrimeBite blues/teals) with contrast for readability.
- **Text:** On-screen labels reinforcing what’s happening (“Major window,” “Bite rating 2.4/5 Fair,” “Activity peaks here”).
- **Transparency element:** Persistent small tag like “AI visuals • real PrimeBite data” in a corner.

## Narrative Patterns

These are repeatable structures that can generate many variations:

1. **“Today’s Bite Window in 10 Seconds”**
   - Start with a simple 24-hour timeline.
   - As time scrolls, fish icons fade in/out at PrimeBite’s major/minor windows.
   - Brief text callouts: “Better from 9:20–11:20 AM,” “Fair overall, but this spike matters.”

2. **“Guessing vs PrimeBite”**
   - Split-screen timeline:
     - Left: random “guessed” times (few fish icons).
     - Right: PrimeBite window (lots of fish icons).
   - Clear takeaway: timing is what changes, not “luck.”

3. **“Why Today Is Only 2.4/5 Fair”**
   - Use the Expanded Technical Details screenshot as a centerpiece.
   - Animate arrows from each factor (moon phase, overlap, base lift) into a final rating.
   - Final text: “Even on ‘fair’ days, timing matters.”

## Sora 2 Implementation Notes

- **Format:** Vertical, 10–15s per clip.  
- **Input assets:**  
  - Today Tab bite window card.  
  - 24-hour activity timeline.  
  - Expanded technical details.  
  - Research & Sources screenshot.
- **Prompt style (high level, not full scripts):**
  - Emphasize “animated data visualizations,” “no real camera footage,” “no realistic humans.”
  - Describe camera moves (slow pan across timeline, zoom into peaks).
  - Specify on-screen text for 1–2 key lines per clip, not dense paragraphs.
  - Ask Sora to treat screenshots as **floating panels or cards** that animate in, not as phones in hands.

## Messaging Pillars

- “PrimeBite turns moon, sun, and weather into simple bite windows.”  
- “Not just ‘best spots’ – **best times**.”  
- “Even on fair days, windows still exist if you know when to look.”

## Example Hook Angles (Not Full Scripts)

- “Here’s what today’s walleye bite window actually looks like…”  
- “If your day looks like this, you’re probably guessing.”  
- “Why your ‘slow day’ still had a hidden 2-hour window.”

## Measurement & Testing Ideas

- **Compare** performance vs existing UGC talking-head content:
  - Hook retention (2–3 second view).  
  - Avg watch time on 10–15s data-explainer clips.  
  - Saves/shares (do anglers save data explainers more than ‘stories’?).
- Test a few variants:
  - Short, pure visual (no VO, just text + music).
  - VO + visuals combo.
  - Pure UI plus minimal animation vs heavier animated world.

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Risk:** Feels too “techy” or abstract for some anglers.
  - Mitigation: Keep labels simple (“Good,” “Fair,” “Better here”), use icons (fish, rods, moons).
- **Risk:** Lower emotional engagement (no human face).
  - Mitigation: Lean on sound design and satisfying animation; keep clips short and visually punchy.

## Variations to Explore Later

- Species-specific variants (walleye-only, offshore-only timelines).  
- Seasonal themes (ice season, summer, fall turnover) with different background palettes.  
- “Myth vs data” micro-explainers (e.g., “Full moon is always best” vs what the chart actually shows).
