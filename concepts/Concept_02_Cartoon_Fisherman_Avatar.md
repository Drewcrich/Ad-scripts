Title: Cartoon / Stylized Fisherman Avatar

## Overview

This concept replaces “realistic TikTok fisherman” with a clearly animated, stylized fisherman character.  
The avatar lives in a cartoon world and interacts with PrimeBite data as oversized, floating UI panels, making it impossible to confuse the content with real footage.

## Objectives

- Keep a “host” in the videos without showing a real person.  
- Make the character memorable and brandable over time.  
- Use the avatar to teach bite windows, timing, and app usage in a friendly, story-like way.  
- Signal clearly that this is **animation + AI**, not an attempt to fake real fishing footage.

## Visual Style & Tone

- **Style:** 2D or 3D cartoon.
  - Exaggerated proportions (slightly big head, simple facial features).
  - Smooth, simple shading (cel-shaded or soft gradients).
  - Cartoon boat, cartoon lake, no photoreal water.
- **Tone:** Relaxed, “buddy at the dock” energy – but clearly a character.
- **World:** Simple looping background (dock, lake horizon, simple clouds), reduced detail.
- **PrimeBite integration:** Large floating panels of the Today Tab, 24-hour timeline, and Research pages that appear next to the character.

## Character Concept

- Age: Feels mid-20s to mid-30s, but stylized.  
- Outfit: Hoodie + beanie as a nod to existing UGC identity, but in cartoon form.  
- Personality:
  - Helpful, not salesy.  
  - Slightly playful, but grounded in actual fishing knowledge.  
- Reusability:
  - Same avatar across multiple scripts to build recognition.

## Narrative Patterns

1. **“Cartoon Fisherman Checks the Window”**
   - Avatar stands on dock, looks at phone.
   - A giant Today Tab card pops up over the water.
   - He points to a highlighted bite window and explains why he’s going *then*, not “whenever.”

2. **“Bad Timing vs Good Timing”**
   - Scene 1: Avatar in boat with almost no fish icons under the water.
   - Scene 2: Same boat at PrimeBite window, fish icons crowd in.
   - Text/VO: “Same spot. Different time.”

3. **“What a 2.4/5 Day Actually Means”**
   - Avatar looks confused at a “Fair” rating.
   - Research/Technical Detail card slides in, he points to different sections.
   - Simplified explanation: “Fair doesn’t mean ‘don’t go’ – it means ‘timing matters more’.”

## Sora 2 Implementation Notes

- **Format:** 10–15 second vertical clips, with option to stitch.  
- **Prompt style (high level):**
  - Specify “cartoon fisherman avatar” and “animated environment” to avoid realism.
  - Ask for “simple, clean lines and colors” and “no photorealistic human skin or water.”
  - Detail how PrimeBite UI should appear (floating rectangular panels, clearly readable).
  - Instruct Sora when to show or hide the UI panel (e.g., during explanation moments).
- **Screenshot usage:**
  - Provide Today Tab, timeline, and Research screenshots as image inputs.
  - Ask Sora to treat them as billboards/cards in the scene, not as a phone UI in a hand.

## Messaging Pillars

- “Timing is the cheat code most anglers ignore.”  
- “PrimeBite doesn’t pick spots for you – it tells you **when** they wake up.”  
- “Even a cartoon fisherman can fish smarter with the right data.”

## Example Hook Angles (Not Full Scripts)

- “Watch what happens when he goes **before** the PrimeBite window vs during it.”  
- “This little chart decides whether our cartoon buddy freezes or feasts.”  
- “What does ‘Fair’ really mean in PrimeBite? Let’s break it down.”

## Measurement & Testing Ideas

- Measure:
  - Viewer comments about the avatar (“love this little dude,” etc.).  
  - Save/share rate vs pure data visualizations.  
  - Whether animated host gets more rewatch than no-host explainers.
- Run side-by-side tests:
  - Same educational content with avatar vs data-only vs old UGC style (if still available) to compare retention.

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Risk:** Feels “too childish” for hardcore anglers.
  - Mitigation: Keep language and explanations mature and technical enough; avoid slapstick humor.
- **Risk:** Character design misses the mark and distracts from data.
  - Mitigation: Keep the design simple and neutral at first; refine details later based on feedback.

## Variations to Explore Later

- Seasonal outfits (ice-fishing gear, rain jacket, summer tee).  
- Different backgrounds (river, offshore, small lake) using same avatar.  
- Light character continuity (running jokes, catchphrases) for viewers who see multiple videos.
