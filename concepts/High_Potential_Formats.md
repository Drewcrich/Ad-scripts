**Purpose:** Formats designed to break through the 1-2,000 view ceiling and drive higher engagement.

## 1. "Reacting to Comments" (Concept 05)

**Format:** "People said X in the comments. Here's the truth..."

**Why it works:**
- Drives engagement (people comment to get featured)
- Creates comment threads (replies to replies)
- Shareable (people tag friends who said X)
- Builds community

**Example Hook:** "People said 'Apps don't work for fishing.' Watch this."

**Structure:**
- Clip 1: Show the comment/claim
- Clip 2: Show the proof/results
- Clip 3: CTA + AI disclosure

**Best for:** Addressing common objections, building trust, driving comments

## 2. "Tell Me You're a Fisherman Without Telling Me"

**Format:** Quick cuts showing fishing habits/routines

**Why it works:**
- Relatable (everyone nods along)
- Shareable (people tag fishing buddies)
- Trend-friendly (fits current TikTok format)
- Pattern interrupt (different from standard testimonial)

**Example Hook:** "Tell me you use PrimeBite without telling me" (showing pre-trip checks, timing routines)

**Structure:**
- Multiple quick cuts (2-3 seconds each)
- No dialogue, just actions
- Text overlay: "Tell me you're a fisherman..."
- Final clip: CTA

**Best for:** Relatability, shareability, trend participation

## 3. "I Was Wrong" / "I Admitted I Was Wrong"

**Format:** Admitting a mistake, then showing the solution

**Why it works:**
- Relatable (everyone makes mistakes)
- Builds trust (vulnerability = authenticity)
- Pattern interrupt (most people don't admit being wrong)
- Creates curiosity (what changed their mind?)

**Example Hook:** "I said moon phases were BS. I was wrong. Here's what changed my mind."

**Structure:**
- Clip 1: The admission ("I was wrong about...")
- Clip 2: What changed their mind (the proof)
- Clip 3: Results + CTA

**Best for:** Overcoming skepticism, building credibility, relatability

## 4. Split-Screen Comparison

**Format:** Side-by-side "Without App" vs "With App"

**Why it works:**
- Clear visual proof (no explanation needed)
- Easy to understand (instant comparison)
- Shareable (visual impact)
- Pattern interrupt (different from standard format)

**Example Hook:** "Same day. Same spot. Different timing."

**Structure:**
- Split screen showing:
  - Left: Empty cooler, frustrated angler (wrong time)
  - Right: Full cooler, happy angler (right time)
- Text overlay: "Without PrimeBite" vs "With PrimeBite"
- Final clip: CTA

**Best for:** Visual proof, clear value proposition, shareability

## 5. "The App Told Me to Do THIS" (Counterintuitive)

**Format:** App suggests something unexpected, then proof

**Why it works:**
- Curiosity gap (what's the weird suggestion?)
- Pattern interrupt (goes against common wisdom)
- Creates "wait, what?" moment
- Drives comments (people question it)

**Example Hook:** "The app said fish at 2 PM in full sun. Everyone said I was crazy. Watch what happened."

**Structure:**
- Clip 1: The counterintuitive suggestion
- Clip 2: The doubt/skepticism
- Clip 3: The proof (it worked!)
- Clip 4: CTA

**Best for:** Pattern interrupts, curiosity, engagement

## 6. "I Tried X for 30 Days"

**Format:** Challenge format, results-driven

**Why it works:**
- Proven format (works across niches)
- Builds anticipation (what were the results?)
- Relatable (everyone wants to try challenges)
- Results-driven (clear outcome)

**Example Hook:** "I fished ONLY during PrimeBite windows for 30 days. Results:"

**Structure:**
- Clip 1: The challenge announcement
- Clip 2: Quick montage of fishing days
- Clip 3: Results reveal (stats, catches, etc.)
- Clip 4: CTA

**Best for:** Results-driven content, challenge format, anticipation

## 7. "POV: You Finally Listened to the App"

**Format:** First-person perspective of success moment

**Why it works:**
- Immersive (feels like you're there)
- Aspirational (shows what's possible)
- Trend-friendly (POV format is huge)
- Emotional connection

**Example Hook:** "POV: You check the app, go at the right time, catch a monster"

**Structure:**
- POV shots (first-person perspective)
- Show the journey: Check app → Go fishing → Success
- Minimal dialogue, maximum visuals
- Final clip: CTA

**Best for:** Aspiration, immersion, trend participation

## 8. "Everyone's Doing It Wrong"

**Format:** Controversial take, then proof

**Why it works:**
- Pattern interrupt (challenges common wisdom)
- Drives comments (people defend their methods)
- Creates curiosity (what's the right way?)
- Shareable (people tag friends who do it wrong)

**Example Hook:** "Everyone checks the app when they get to the water. That's too late."

**Structure:**
- Clip 1: The controversial claim
- Clip 2: Why it's wrong (explanation)
- Clip 3: The right way (proof)
- Clip 4: CTA

**Best for:** Pattern interrupts, engagement, education

## Testing Priority

**High Priority (Test First):**
1. "Reacting to Comments" - Highest engagement potential
2. "The App Told Me to Do THIS" - Strong curiosity gap
3. Split-Screen Comparison - Clear visual proof

**Medium Priority:**
4. "I Was Wrong" - Builds trust
5. "Everyone's Doing It Wrong" - Drives engagement

**Lower Priority (Test Later):**
6. "Tell Me You're a Fisherman" - Trend-dependent
7. "I Tried X for 30 Days" - Requires longer timeline
8. "POV: You Finally Listened" - Similar to existing formats

---

## Notes

- All formats should maintain **content-first** approach (not advertisement)
- Include **AI disclosure** in all videos
- Keep **dialogue limits** (10s = max 30 words, 15s = max 45 words)
- Use **proven species** (Walleye, Pike, Muskie, Tuna) unless testing new angle
- Track which formats break through 2K view ceiling

---

**Status:** Ready to test. Create scripts using these formats and track performance.
