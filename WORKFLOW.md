## 📋 The Workflow

```
You: "Create Script [NUMBER] using the template and analytics data"

AI: 
1. Reads AI_GUIDE.md (gets all rules + template)
2. Reads analytics/shorts-log.csv (sees what's working)
3. Reads top-performing scripts (learns patterns)
4. Creates Script [NUMBER] following lean template
```

## 🎬 Example Usage

**You say:**
```
Create Script 19 using the template and analytics data
```

**AI will:**
- ✅ Read AI_GUIDE.md for all rules and template
- ✅ Analyze analytics/shorts-log.csv for top performers
- ✅ Read those top scripts to understand patterns
- ✅ Create Script 19 with proper format, dialogue limits, and all rules followed
- ✅ Use lean template (80 lines visible + analytics collapsed)

## 📊 What Matters

The system tracks 3 things:
1. **Scripts** - The prompts, dialogue, structure
2. **CapCut Instructions** - Overlays, text, timing
3. **Title** - The hook that drives clicks

Everything else is just support documentation for the AI.
