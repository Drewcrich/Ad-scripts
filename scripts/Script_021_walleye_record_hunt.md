Vertical selfie video filmed on a phone. Night on the boat. The main fisherman holds a gigantic 26-inch Walleye horizontally with two hands. It's huge. He is hyping it up to the camera, shaking his head in disbelief. A buddy in the background is celebrating. Raw, authentic UGC energy. "We just caught the lake record!" vibe.
