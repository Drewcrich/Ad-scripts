**Species:** Walleye  
**Style:** UGC pre-trip routine (three-clip stitched video)  
**Platforms:** TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels  
**Concept:** Concept 07 - UGC Fisherman Testimonial

**Note:** This script uses three clips (12s + 15s + 15s) that will be stitched together in CapCut for a 42-second total video. Based on Script 004's success (1,611 TikTok views, 8.2s retention) with multi-clip tip + payoff format.

- **Option C:** Mid-40s male, fishing shirt, trucker hat (seasoned angler)

## Clip 1 – The Hook: Pre-Trip Routine

### Hook line

"I don't even back down the driveway until this screen looks right."

### Sora prompt (Clip 1)

"Vertical selfie video filmed on a phone. A [CHARACTER: late 30s male wearing a flannel shirt and baseball cap] is sitting in his truck cab at dawn, soft morning light coming through the windshield. He's holding his phone in one hand, showing it briefly to the camera. Keys are visible in the ignition but the truck isn't started. It should feel like real TikTok UGC: slight phone shake, natural lighting, and phone-mic audio.

He speaks directly to the camera with a calm, genuine tone and says: 'I don't even back down the driveway until this screen looks right. I open PrimeBite, check today's bite windows for walleye, and I only plan my night trips around these times. I'm not just burning gas and guessing anymore.'

Keep his delivery relaxed and practical, like he's sharing a real habit, not selling anything. Include subtle truck cab sounds (keys jingling, seat adjustment, maybe coffee cup). Leave clean space in the upper-right area of the frame so I can add a screenshot overlay later."

### Sora clip length and orientation
- Orientation: Portrait
- Length: 12 seconds
(These are set in the Sora UI, not in the prompt text.)

### Character creation note
- Create the character in Sora 2 for Clip 1. Save/reference this character for use in Clips 2 and 3.

## Clip 2 – The Payoff: On the Water Results

### Hook / continuation

"So last night, I checked the app before leaving..."

### Character consistency
- **Use the same character created in Clip 1** - In Sora 2, select/reference the character from Clip 1 to maintain consistency across clips.

### Sora prompt (Clip 2)

"Vertical selfie video filmed on a phone. Same fisherman, now on a boat at night with a soft headlamp glow. He's holding a nice walleye with both hands, fish clearly visible. It should feel like real TikTok UGC: slight phone shake, natural low-light with headlamp, and phone-mic audio.

He actively speaks to camera with a satisfied, almost surprised tone and says: 'So last night, I checked the app before leaving. It said the major window was from 8:15 to 10:15 PM. I launched at 8, and by 8:30 I had this one. Twenty-three inches. The window was spot on. I would've shown up at 6 PM like I used to, but the app said wait—so I waited.'

Keep his delivery genuine and excited but humble, like he's sharing real results. Include subtle water sounds and night ambiance. Leave clean space in the upper-right corner so I can add a screenshot overlay later."

### Sora clip length and orientation
- Orientation: Portrait
- Length: 15 seconds
(These are set in the Sora UI, not in the prompt text.)

## Clip 3 – AI Transparency & Credibility

### Hook / continuation

"Oh, and real quick before you go..."

### Character consistency
- **Use the same character created in Clip 1** - In Sora 2, select/reference the character from Clip 1 to maintain consistency across clips.

### Sora prompt (Clip 3)

"Vertical selfie video filmed on a phone. Same fisherman, still on the boat at night, casual and relaxed. Headlamp still on. It should feel like raw TikTok UGC: slight shake, natural low-light, and phone-mic audio.

He looks directly at the camera with a genuine, straightforward expression and says: 'Oh, and real quick before you go—yeah, we use AI to make these videos. But the PrimeBite bite windows and ratings? That's 100% real data. The app shows you exactly how we calculate everything—full research document, technical appendix, all our sources. It's all there. We rate how good each bite window is based on real science. The app doesn't lie. Try it yourself.'

Keep his delivery authentic and transparent, not defensive. Matter-of-fact and conversational, like casually addressing the obvious. Include subtle water sounds. Leave clean space in the upper-right corner so I can add a screenshot overlay later."

### Sora clip length and orientation

- Fade in at 5s (0.3s), fade out at 11s (0.3s)
- Optional small text under screenshot: "my pre-trip check"

**Clip 2 (12-27s):**
- Use the same Today Tab bite-window screenshot

**Total video length:** 42 seconds (12s + 15s + 15s)

## Caption Notes (CapCut)

**IMPORTANT:** Add auto-captions to all three clips for accessibility and engagement. Captions increase watch time and make content accessible.

### Caption Settings in CapCut

1. **Auto-Generate Captions:**
   - Import all clips into CapCut
   - Select all clips
   - Go to "Text" → "Auto Captions"
   - Language: English
   - Let CapCut generate captions automatically

2. **Caption Style:**
   - **Font:** Bold, sans-serif (e.g., "Montserrat Bold" or "Bebas Neue")
   - **Size:** Large enough to read on mobile (adjust for 9:16 vertical format)
   - **Color:** White text with black outline/shadow for readability
   - **Position:** Lower third (bottom 25% of screen) to avoid covering face and screenshot overlay
   - **Animation:** Word-by-word or phrase-by-phrase pop-in (keeps attention)
   - **Background:** Optional semi-transparent black bar behind text for extra readability

3. **Caption Timing:**
   - **Clip 1 (0-12s):** Captions for entire dialogue
   - **Clip 2 (12-27s):** Captions for entire dialogue
   - **Clip 3 (27-42s):** Captions for entire dialogue
   - Ensure captions sync perfectly with speech (adjust timing if needed)

4. **Key Phrases to Emphasize:**
   - Clip 1: "I don't even back down the driveway" (make this line stand out)
   - Clip 2: "8:15 to 10:15 PM" and "window was spot on" (emphasize timing)
   - Clip 3: "100% real data," "bite windows and ratings," and "we rate how good each bite window is" (emphasize credibility and rating system)

5. **Caption Best Practices:**
   - Keep captions on screen for full duration of spoken words
   - Use all caps for emphasis on key phrases (optional)
   - Ensure captions don't cover the app screenshot overlay (position lower if needed)
   - Test readability on mobile device before posting

## Performance Notes

(To be filled in later in analytics/shorts-log.csv once view/like data is available.)

**Testing focus:** This script tests a unique setting (truck cab) and pre-trip planning angle, based on Script 004's successful multi-clip format (1,611 TikTok views, 8.2s retention). The "don't back down driveway" hook is specific and memorable, creating a strong pattern interrupt.

**AI Acknowledgment:** Clip 3 includes AI acknowledgment with emphasis on credibility (research document, technical appendix, sources) AND explains the rating system ("we rate how good each bite window is"), paired with Research & Sources screenshot for visual proof. This addresses both transparency and app functionality.

**Character Variation:** Using a different character profile (late 30s, flannel, baseball cap) to add diversity and avoid repetitive "hoodie + beanie" look.

**Captions:** First script to include detailed caption instructions, which should increase accessibility and watch time.

**Key differentiators from other scripts:**
- Unique setting: truck cab (not garage or boat)
- Pre-trip planning focus (before leaving home)
- Specific, memorable hook ("don't back down driveway")
- Three-clip format following Script 004's success pattern
- Includes captions for accessibility and engagement
- Character variation to avoid repetition

## Strategy Notes

**Why this script should perform well:**

1. **Follows proven format:** 3-clip structure like Scripts 004, 006, 008, 009 (all had good retention)
2. **Routine/tip-based:** Scripts 004 and 005 performed best with this angle
3. **Unique setting:** Truck cab is fresh, not overused like garage/boat
4. **Memorable hook:** "Don't back down driveway" is specific and pattern-interrupting
5. **Content-first:** Feels like genuine tip, not an ad (per your request)
6. **Character diversity:** Different appearance to avoid repetition
7. **Captions:** Increases accessibility and watch time
8. **Visual proof:** Screenshots + captions reinforce the message
9. **AI transparency:** Builds trust while showing credibility (research/sources)

**Expected performance:** Based on Script 004's success (1,611 TikTok views, 8.2s retention) with similar multi-clip tip + payoff format, this should perform in the 800-1,500 view range on TikTok and 1,000-1,500 on YouTube. The 42-second length is similar to successful Scripts 008 and 009 (40s each).
