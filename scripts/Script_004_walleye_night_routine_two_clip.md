# Script 004 – Walleye Night Routine (two-clip stitched video)

**Species:** Walleye  
**Style:** UGC tip (Clip 1) + payoff (Clip 2)  

## Clip 1 – Night routine tip

### Hook line

"If you fish walleye at night, here's the little routine that works for me."

### Sora prompt (Clip 1)

"Vertical selfie video filmed on a phone. A mid-20s to mid-30s fisherman wearing a hoodie and beanie is sitting in his boat at night with a soft headlamp glow. It should feel like real TikTok UGC: slight phone shake, natural low-light noise, and phone-mic audio.

He speaks quietly but clearly to the camera and says something like: 'If you fish walleye at night, here's the little routine that works for me. I kill the noise, give the spot ten quiet minutes, and just drag a jig stupid slow along the break. And before I even launch, I check a simple timing chart so I'm not just guessing.'

Keep his delivery calm and confident, like he's giving a genuine tip, not an ad. Include subtle water and boat sounds. Leave some clean space in the upper-right area of the frame so I can add a small graphic later."

## Clip 2 – Payoff

### Hook / continuation

"So I ran that same slow jig along the break…"

### Sora prompt (Clip 2)

"Vertical selfie video filmed on a phone. Same fisherman, still on the boat at night with a headlamp. It should feel like raw TikTok UGC: slight shake, natural low-light noise, and phone-mic audio.

He holds a nice walleye in both hands and talks to the camera in a relaxed, almost surprised tone. He says something like: 'So I ran that same slow jig along the break and… yeah, they were there. That little timing chart I showed you was pretty much spot on tonight.'

Keep his reaction genuine, not overacted. Include subtle water and boat sounds. Leave clean space in the upper-right corner so I can add a small graphic later."
