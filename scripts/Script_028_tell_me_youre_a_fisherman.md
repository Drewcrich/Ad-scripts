Vertical selfie video filmed on a phone. A mid-30s fisherman wearing a beanie and hoodie sits in his truck at dawn. Soft morning light through windshield.

He speaks directly to camera: "Yeah, we use AI for these videos. But that PrimeBite app? That's real. Check your bite windows before you go."

Soft background music plays (lower volume so his voice is clear). Leave clean space in top-right corner for overlay.
