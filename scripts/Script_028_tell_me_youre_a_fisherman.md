- If trend has faded, this format still works but may perform differently
- Consider using whatever fishing-related trend is currently hot

## Alternative Scenes (If Needed)

If any scenes don't generate well in Sora, swap with these:

- **Alt Scene:** Close-up of weather app open, then switching to PrimeBite app
- **Alt Scene:** Tackle box being organized at 3 AM with phone nearby showing bite windows
- **Alt Scene:** Hands holding phone with fishing forum post: "When do you go?" Reply: "When the app says to."
- **Alt Scene:** Calendar with multiple days crossed out, one day circled with "MAJOR WINDOW 8AM" written

## Strategic Notes

### Content Mix:

- This is UGC format (maintaining 70% UGC / 30% Cinematic ratio)
- Concept 07 (UGC Fisherman Testimonial) but with trend integration

### Testing Hypothesis:

Trend formats may outperform standard talking-head scripts due to:

- Built-in discovery (trend algorithm boost)
- Higher shareability (trend participation)
- Tag mechanics (viral loop)
- Lower barrier to entry (no education needed)

### If This Performs Well:

- Create more trend-integrated scripts
- Stay current with TikTok fishing trends
- Consider other "Tell me you're [X]" variations for different species/situations

### If This Underperforms:

- May indicate trend has faded
- Audience may prefer educational/story-driven content
- Return to proven formats (Scripts 014, 015, 019 structure)
