## Clip 1 – The Skepticism: Poor Rating Discovery

**Hook line**

"The app just gave today a 1 out of 5 rating. Poor. But check this out..."

**Sora prompt (Clip 1)**

**📋 PASTE FROM HERE ↓**

Vertical selfie video filmed on a phone. A mid-30s fisherman wearing a baseball cap and fishing jacket is sitting in his truck at dawn. He's holding his phone, looking at it with a skeptical, confused expression.

He speaks: "The app just gave today a 1 out of 5 rating. Poor. Normally I'd stay home. But it still shows a window from 6:30 to 8:30 AM with a 2.5 rating. On a 1 out of 5 day. That doesn't make sense... but I'm gonna try it."

Chill background music plays (lower volume so his voice is clear). Leave clean space in top-right corner for overlay.

## Performance Notes

(To be filled in later in analytics/shorts-log.csv once view/like data is available.)

Testing focus: This script tests counterintuitive content (fishing on 1/5 Poor days) using High-Potential Format #2. The hook challenges assumptions (everyone skips Poor days), creates curiosity ("Why fish on a 1/5 day?"), and delivers proof that windows work even on terrible days. Teaches window ratings matter more than overall day ratings.

Expected performance: Target 2,500+ views, high shares (tag-worthy), strong comment engagement (questions/discussion), 65%+ retention.

## Pinned Comment

"This is the difference between day ratings and window ratings. 📊 Even on 1/5 days, the windows are still there—just fish them smarter. Download PrimeBite to see your local windows. 🎣"
