# Script 027 – Walleye: "The App Said 1/5 Poor Would Still Work"

**Species:** Walleye  
**Style:** UGC Counterintuitive Discovery (four-clip stitched video)  
**Platforms:** TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels  
**Concept:** Concept 07 - UGC Fisherman Testimonial + High-Potential Format #2

**Viral Strategy:** This script uses counterintuitive content to create massive shareability. The hook challenges conventional wisdom (everyone skips "Poor" rated days), creates a curiosity gap ("Why would you fish on a 1/5 day?"), and delivers surprising proof that builds trust in the app's accuracy even on bad days.

**Note:** This script uses four clips (15s + 10s + 15s + 15s) that will be stitched together in CapCut for a 55-second total video.

## Clip 1 – The Skepticism: Poor Rating Discovery

**Hook line**

"The app just gave today a 1 out of 5 rating. Poor. But check this out..."

**Sora prompt (Clip 1)**

**📋 PASTE FROM HERE ↓**

Vertical selfie video filmed on a phone. A mid-30s fisherman wearing a baseball cap and fishing jacket is sitting in his truck at dawn. He's holding his phone, looking at it with a skeptical, confused expression.

He speaks: "The app just gave today a 1 out of 5 rating. Poor. Normally I'd stay home. But it still shows a window from 6:30 to 8:30 AM with a 2.5 rating. On a 1 out of 5 day. That doesn't make sense... but I'm gonna try it."

Chill background music plays (lower volume so his voice is clear). Leave clean space in top-right corner for overlay.

**↑ TO HERE 📋**

**Duration:** 15 seconds | **Orientation:** Portrait

**Character Note:** Create character in Sora 2. Save/reference for other clips.

**Dialogue Word Count:** 44 words (within 45-word limit for 15s)

**Hook / continuation**

"So I'm out here. 6:45 AM. On a Poor day."

**Sora prompt (Clip 2)**

**📋 PASTE FROM HERE ↓**

Vertical selfie video filmed on a phone. Same fisherman on a boat at dawn. Golden morning light. He looks uncertain but determined.

He speaks: "So I'm out here. Six forty-five AM. On a Poor day. If this works, I'll never doubt the windows again."

Chill background music plays (lower volume so his voice is clear). Leave clean space in top-right corner for overlay.

**↑ TO HERE 📋**

## Clip 3 – The Proof: It Worked

**Hook / continuation**

"Seven-oh-eight AM. On a ONE out of FIVE day."

**Sora prompt (Clip 3)**

**📋 PASTE FROM HERE ↓**

Vertical selfie video filmed on a phone. Same fisherman on boat, holding a nice walleye with both hands.

He speaks: "Seven-oh-eight AM. On a ONE out of FIVE day. Twenty-six inches. The WINDOW works even when the overall day rating is terrible. This is the difference between fishing randomly and fishing the windows. Mind blown."

Upbeat background music plays (lower volume so his voice is clear). Leave clean space in top-right corner for overlay.

## Notes for Video Creator

**Emotional Arc:**

- Clip 1: Skeptical, confused, uncertain ("This doesn't make sense...")
- Clip 2: Determined but doubtful ("If this works, I'll never doubt...")
- Clip 3: Shocked, excited, amazed ("Mind blown")
- Clip 4: Educational, confident, helpful ("Don't skip—fish smarter")

**Visual Continuity:**

- Clip 1: Truck cab at dawn (pre-trip planning, phone in hand)
- Clip 2: Boat at dawn (golden morning light, commitment moment)
- Clip 3: Boat in morning light (holding walleye, success moment)
- Clip 4: Same boat setting (calm water, dawn light, reflection)
- Maintain "calm water" across Clips 2, 3, and 4 for consistency

**Dialogue Pacing:**

- Clip 1 (15s): 44 words - Natural conversational pace
- Clip 2 (10s): 24 words - Short, punchy, determined
- Clip 3 (15s): 40 words - Excited but clear
- Clip 4 (15s): 44 words - Educational, confident, helpful
- All clips stay within word limits (10s = max 30, 15s = max 45)

**Key Message:**

Don't judge fishing days by overall ratings alone. Even on "Poor" 1/5 days, the bite windows are still there—they're just shorter or weaker. The difference between getting skunked and catching fish is fishing DURING the window, not randomly throughout a poor day. The app's window ratings (2.5/5 inside a 1/5 day) show you exactly when to be on the water, even when the overall conditions suck.

**Viral Mechanics:**

This script exploits the "Wait, what?" reaction. People will:

- Stop scrolling at "1 out of 5 Poor"
- Watch to see if it's clickbait
- Be shocked it worked
- Tag friends who skip fishing on bad days
- Comment asking questions
- Save to reference later

**Character Profile:**

- Mid-30s male fisherman
- Baseball cap and fishing jacket (casual, relatable)
- Truck cab setting (pre-trip planning, common scenario)
- Skeptical but willing to test (relatable mindset)
- Genuine excitement when proven wrong (authentic reaction)

**Audio Notes:**

- Clip 1: Chill music (softer, contemplative)
- Clip 2: Same chill music continues (building tension)
- Clip 3: Upbeat music (celebratory, energetic)
- Clip 4: Soft music (educational, confident)
- All music at lower volume so dialogue is crystal clear
