## Clip 1 – The Comment & Reaction

**📋 PASTE FROM HERE ↓**

Vertical handheld video. A friendly mid-30s fisherman on a boat at dawn. Golden morning light. He starts by showing 2-3 walleye on the boat deck or in a cooler, clearly visible (first 2-3 seconds). Then he picks one up and looks directly at the camera with an excited, energetic expression.

He speaks with enthusiasm: "People keep saying fishing apps are BS. But this app told me the fish would bite at 6:15 AM. I showed up at 6:00. At 6:15 on the dot, my rod bent. That's not luck. That's science. Watch this."

Keep his delivery energetic and excited, but still friendly. Like he's genuinely amazed and wants to share. Upbeat background music plays (lower volume so his voice is clear). Include ambient sounds (water, boat). Leave clean space in top-right corner for overlay.

Raw UGC feel: slight phone shake, natural lighting, phone-mic audio.

Vertical handheld video. Same fisherman, back on boat at dawn. Friendly, educational expression. Raw UGC feel: natural lighting, phone-mic audio.

He speaks directly to camera: "So yeah, apps CAN work—if they're backed by real science. PrimeBite shows you bite windows based on moon phases and weather. It's all research-backed. Quick note: This video is AI-generated, but those bite windows? 100% real. Download PrimeBite on the App Store."
