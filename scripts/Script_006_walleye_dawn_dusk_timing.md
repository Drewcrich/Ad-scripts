# Script 006 – Walleye Dawn/Dusk Timing (Three-clip stitched video)

**Species:** Walleye  
**Style:** UGC educational tip (Clip 1) + explanation (Clip 2) + payoff (Clip 3)  
**Platforms:** TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels  

## Clip 1 – Hook & Setup

### Hook line

"If you're missing walleye at dawn, you're probably showing up at the wrong time."

### Sora prompt (Clip 1)

"Vertical selfie video filmed on a phone. A mid-20s to mid-30s fisherman wearing a hoodie and beanie is standing on a dock or boat ramp at dawn, with soft morning light in the background. It should feel like real TikTok UGC: slight phone shake, natural lighting, and phone-mic audio.

He talks directly to the camera with a knowing, slightly frustrated tone and says: 'If you're missing walleye at dawn, you're probably showing up at the wrong time. I used to roll up right at sunrise thinking that was the magic hour, but I was always a step behind.'

Keep his delivery conversational and relatable, like he's sharing a lesson learned. Include subtle ambient morning sounds (water, distant birds). Leave clean space in the upper-right corner so I can add a screenshot overlay later."

### Sora clip length and orientation
- Orientation: Portrait
- Length: 10 seconds
(These are set in the Sora UI, not in the prompt text.)

### Character creation note

## Clip 2 – The Tip/Explanation

### Hook / continuation

"Here's what changed everything for me…"

### Character consistency
- **Use the same character created in Clip 1** - In Sora 2, select/reference the character from Clip 1 to maintain consistency across clips.

### Sora prompt (Clip 2)

"Vertical selfie video filmed on a phone. Same fisherman, now sitting in his boat at dawn with fishing gear visible. The morning light is still soft, maybe a bit brighter. It should feel like raw TikTok UGC: slight shake, natural lighting, phone-mic audio.

He speaks to the camera with a calm, educational tone, like he's genuinely helping someone. He says: 'Here's what changed everything for me. I started checking when the bite window actually starts, not just when the sun comes up. Sometimes that window opens 30 minutes before sunrise, sometimes it's 20 minutes after. The app shows you exactly when, and I'm not guessing anymore.'

Keep his delivery confident but not preachy, like he's sharing a real game-changer. Include subtle water and boat sounds. Leave clean space in the upper-right corner so I can add a screenshot overlay later."

### Sora clip length and orientation
- Orientation: Portrait
- Length: 15 seconds
(These are set in the Sora UI, not in the prompt text.)

## Clip 3 – Payoff/Results

### Hook / continuation

"And look, it actually works."

### Character consistency
- **Use the same character created in Clip 1** - In Sora 2, select/reference the character from Clip 1 to maintain consistency across clips.

### Sora prompt (Clip 3)

"Vertical selfie video filmed on a phone. Same fisherman, still in the boat at dawn, now holding a nice walleye up to the camera with both hands. It should feel like authentic TikTok UGC: slight shake, natural morning light, phone-mic audio.

He is actively talking to the camera, speaking clearly with lip sync and hand gestures. He holds the fish up while speaking. He says with a relaxed, almost matter-of-fact tone: 'And look, it actually works. This one hit right at 6:15, which was exactly when the window said it would be hot. No more showing up late and wondering why they're not biting.'

He is speaking throughout the clip, not just smiling silently. Keep his delivery genuine and understated - like this is just how it works now, not a big surprise. Include natural audio of his voice and subtle water sounds. Leave clean space in the upper-right corner so I can add a screenshot overlay later."

### Sora clip length and orientation
- Orientation: Portrait

- Optional small text under screenshot: "my timing window"

**Clip 3 (25-35s):**

## Performance notes

(To be filled in later in analytics/shorts-log.csv once view/like data is available.)

**Testing focus:** This script tests a 3-clip format (vs. 2-clip in Script 004) to see if additional clips improve engagement and retention. Also tests dawn/dusk timing angle (vs. night routine in Scripts 004-005).
