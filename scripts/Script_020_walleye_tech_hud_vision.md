## Clip 1 – The Scan (Revealing the Invisible)

**📋 PASTE FROM HERE ↓**

Cinematic drone shot of a misty lake at dawn. A futuristic "digital scan wave" effect moves across the water from left to right. As the scan passes, the water surface is overlayed with a glowing cyan wireframe topography grid. Bright orange/red "heat map" zones appear under the surface in specific spots. Floating Augmented Reality (AR) text labels pop up in 3D space: "MOON: OVERHEAD", "ACTIVITY: 98%", "PRESSURE: STABLE". High-tech, sci-fi aesthetic but realistic environment.

## Clip 2 – The Targeting (Syncing Data)

**📋 PASTE FROM HERE ↓**

POV shot of a hand holding a smartphone in front of the same misty lake. The phone screen shows the PrimeBite "Bite Windows" graph. A glowing digital line connects the phone screen to a specific spot on the lake water. The spot on the water pulses with a digital target reticle (HUD style). The phone screen displays "MAJOR WINDOW: OPEN" in bright green. The interface looks like advanced military tech or a video game HUD.

## Clip 3 – The Validation (Target Acquired)

**📋 PASTE FROM HERE ↓**

Close-up action shot. A large Walleye breaks the water surface, splashing. A digital "fighter jet" style locking square snaps onto the fish instantly. HUD text overlays appear rapidly around the fish: "TARGET ACQUIRED", "PREDICTION: VALIDATED", "SIZE: 28 INCH". The visual style is high-energy and victorious. The background is the real lake, but the overlay confirms the "mission success."

## Testing Focus
This script tests:
1. **Visual Style:** "Tech Overlay/HUD" (Concept 03). Does "sci-fi" aesthetic appeal to anglers?
2. **Format:** No human face/talking head. Pure visual storytelling.
3. **Value Prop:** "Data = Vision" (reframing the app as a visibility tool).

**Hypothesis:** The high-tech, video-game aesthetic will stop the scroll for younger demographics and "gear nerds" who love technology.
