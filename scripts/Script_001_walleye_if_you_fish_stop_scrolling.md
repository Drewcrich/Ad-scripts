# Script 001 – Walleye UGC Intro ("If you fish walleye…")

**Species:** Walleye  
**Style:** UGC talking-head + fish shot  
**Platforms:** TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels  

## Hook line (first seconds)

"If you fish walleye, stop scrolling."

## Sora prompt

"Vertical selfie video in vertical format, filmed like a TikTok. A mid-20s to mid-30s fisherman wearing a beanie and hoodie talks directly to the camera in his garage with fishing rods and tackle behind him. He is energetic and grabs attention.

He says, with clear lip sync and hand gestures:

'If you fish walleye, stop scrolling. I never go out without checking my PrimeBite window first.'

After this line, cut quickly to a close-up shot of him on the boat holding a big walleye up to the camera, smiling and a bit hyped, then cut back to the selfie in the garage for the final line:

'It literally tells me when they're going to chew.'

Make the video feel like authentic UGC filmed on a phone: slightly shaky, natural lighting, no cinematic effects. Include natural audio of his voice and a bit of room ambience. Leave some empty space in the top-right corner during the selfie shots where I can add an app screenshot later."

## Overlay / screenshot notes

- Add bite-window screenshot as overlay in top-right.
- Text: "Tonight's Walleye Window".

## Caption + hashtags

(To be filled in by me later.)
