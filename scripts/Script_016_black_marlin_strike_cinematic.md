# Script 016 – Black Marlin Strike (Cinematic POV Action)

**Concept:** Concept 06 - Cinematic Fishing Moments  
**Style:** POV action-packed fishing (two storyboards stitched)  
**Platforms:** TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels  
**Species:** Black Marlin  
**Format:** First-person perspective, intense action

**Creative Twist:** This is your **first cinematic fishing video** - pure action and excitement from start to finish. POV perspective puts the viewer in the moment. Black marlin jumping out of water is the dramatic centerpiece. No talking, just intense fishing action with natural sounds and music. PrimeBite mentioned briefly at the end with App Store CTA.

**Note:** This script uses **two Sora 2 storyboards** (15s + 10s) plus **one regular Sora 2 clip** (15s) with character dialogue and background music. Total video length: 40 seconds. Clip 3 is an all-in-one generation testing Sora's ability to handle dialogue + music + scene together.

## CLIP 3 – AI Disclosure & CTA (15 seconds - Regular Clip, NOT Storyboard)

### Sora 2 Clip Prompt

**📋 PASTE FROM HERE ↓**

Vertical video, 15 seconds. A mid-30s male crew member wearing casual fishing gear stands on a charter boat deck next to a large black marlin lying on the deck. Bright sunny day, blue ocean in background. He looks directly at camera with a confident, genuine expression and speaks clearly: "This video is AI-generated. But PrimeBite? That's 100% real. The app tells you exactly when bite windows open and rates how good they are—all backed by peer-reviewed research. Download PrimeBite on the App Store."

Epic cinematic music plays in the background (softer, resolved tone - continuation of action music from earlier). The music volume is lower so his voice is clear. Natural boat and ocean sounds are also present. He gestures naturally while speaking. The scene feels transparent and credible.

**Immediate Red Flags:**
- Negative comments about realism/AI quality
- Retention below 40% (people leaving early)
- Significant drop in overall channel metrics
- Audience confusion about content type

---

## Testing Notes

**This is a TEST of cinematic format:**
- Post this as 1 of your next 5 videos (80/20 mix with UGC)
- Don't post multiple cinematic videos back-to-back
- Continue creating and posting UGC content (proven format)
- Give it 48-72 hours to gather data
- Assess: Is it entertaining? Does it feel like content or an ad?

**Key Questions After Posting:**
1. Did Sora 2 handle the marlin jump well? (Scene 4 is critical)
2. Does POV perspective feel immersive or awkward?
3. Is the action exciting enough to hold attention?
4. Does the CTA feel natural or forced?
5. Do people engage with the content (likes, comments, shares)?

**Next Steps Based on Performance:**

**If Script 016 performs well (within 80% of UGC):**
1. Create more cinematic content (Format 2: POV Night Walleye, Format 4: Comparison)
2. Continue 70/30 mix (UGC + Cinematic)
3. Test different species and settings

**If Script 016 underperforms (60-80% of UGC):**
1. Analyze why: Was it Sora 2 quality? POV perspective? Species choice?
2. Try Format 4 (Comparison) - more story-driven, less reliant on AI realism
3. Consider hybrid approach (Sora 2 + real footage)

**If Script 016 tanks (below 60% of UGC):**
1. Reassess whether cinematic format fits audience expectations
2. Stick with UGC-heavy approach (it's working)
3. Consider that fishing content may need human connection (not just action)

## Sora 2 Generation Tips

### For Best Results:

**Scene 4 (Marlin Jump) is Critical:**
- This is the hardest scene for Sora 2 to generate
- Specify "far from boat" to reduce complexity
- Accept that it may not be perfect - focus on dramatic impact
- If Sora struggles, consider regenerating just this scene multiple times

**POV Scenes (1-3, 5):**
- Sora 2 handles POV perspectives well
- Hands in frame help ground the perspective
- Rod and reel should be clearly visible

**Wide Shots (4, 6-7):**
- Easier for Sora 2 than POV with action
- Focus on composition and lighting

**If Sora 2 Struggles:**
- Regenerate problem scenes individually
- Adjust prompts to simplify (e.g., "marlin partially visible" instead of full jump)
- Consider hybrid approach (use stock footage for Scene 4)

---

## Production Workflow

1. **Generate Storyboard 1 in Sora 2:**
   - Copy prompt between "PASTE FROM HERE" markers
   - Set orientation to Portrait, total duration 15s, 4 scenes
   - Generate and review

2. **Generate Storyboard 2 in Sora 2:**
   - Copy prompt between "PASTE FROM HERE" markers
   - Set orientation to Portrait, total duration 10s, 2 scenes
   - Generate and review

3. **Generate Clip 3 in Sora 2 (Regular Clip):**
   - Copy prompt between "PASTE FROM HERE" markers
   - Set orientation to Portrait, duration 15s
   - **This is the TEST:** Character speaking + background music + scene all-in-one
   - Generate and review carefully

4. **Review all generations:**
   - Is Scene 4 (marlin jump in Storyboard 1) dramatic and clear?
   - Are POV scenes immersive?
   - **CRITICAL:** Does Clip 3 have clear dialogue over background music?
   - Does the character look natural speaking to camera?
   - Is the audio mix good (dialogue clear, music present but not overpowering)?

5. **CapCut stitching:**
   - Import Storyboard 1, Storyboard 2, and Clip 3
   - Stitch: Storyboard 1 → Storyboard 2 → Clip 3
   - Add music to Storyboards 1 & 2 if needed
   - Review Clip 3 audio - adjust if needed
   - Optional: Add text overlay during Clip 3
   - Export vertical 9:16

6. **If Clip 3 didn't work well:**
   - Regenerate with simpler prompt
   - OR fall back to separate voiceover generation approach
   - Iterate until you get good results

7. **Create thumbnail:**
   - Use frame from Storyboard 1, Scene 4 (marlin jump)
   - Add text: "BLACK MARLIN POV" or "PERFECT TIMING"
   - High contrast, dramatic

8. **Post to platforms:**
   - TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts
   - Use action + offshore hashtags
   - Title emphasizes POV and action
   - Note: AI disclosure is in video, transparent approach

9. **Track performance:**
   - Log in `analytics/shorts-log.csv`
   - Compare to UGC baseline after 48-72 hours
   - Monitor comments about AI disclosure and feature awareness
   - Make data-driven decision on cinematic format

## Key Differentiators from UGC Scripts

**What makes this different:**
- ❌ No talking head or testimonial
- ❌ No personal story or routine
- ❌ No direct-to-camera dialogue
- ✅ Pure action and visuals
- ✅ POV perspective (immersive)
- ✅ Cinematic, polished look
- ✅ Intense music and sound design
- ✅ Trophy fish and dramatic moments
- ✅ Brief CTA (not explanation)

**Why this works alongside UGC:**
- UGC = Relatability and trust ("people like me")
- Cinematic = Aspiration and excitement ("this is what's possible")
- Together they create balance: emotional connection + visual inspiration

---

## Notes for Video Creator

**Critical Success Factors:**

1. **Scene 4 (Marlin Jump) must deliver:**
   - This is the "wow" moment
   - If Sora struggles, regenerate or use alternative footage
   - The entire video builds to this moment

2. **POV perspective must feel natural:**
   - Hands should look realistic
   - Rod and reel should be clearly visible
   - Motion should feel like you're on a boat

3. **Music is essential:**
   - Builds tension and excitement
   - Enhances emotional impact
   - Makes action feel more dramatic

4. **CTA should feel earned:**
   - After 22 seconds of action, the CTA is a natural conclusion
   - Not forced or salesy - just "here's how we timed this"

**What success looks like:**
- Video feels like a mini action movie
- Viewer is excited and engaged throughout
- Marlin jump is dramatic and satisfying
- Retention above 60% (15+ seconds)
- Comments focus on the action ("that jump!" "so sick!")
- CTA drives curiosity about PrimeBite

---

## Messaging Alignment

**Core message:** "This is what fishing at the perfect time looks like. Intense action, trophy fish, perfect timing. PrimeBite helps you plan for moments like this."

**Tone:** Exciting, intense, aspirational (not educational or salesy)

**Call to action:** "PrimeBite - App Store" (brief, clear, earned after action)

**Brand building:** PrimeBite = timing tool for serious anglers who want results
