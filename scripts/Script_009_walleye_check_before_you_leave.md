# Script 009 – Walleye: Check Before You Leave (Three-clip stitched video)

**Species:** Walleye  
**Style:** UGC educational tip (three-clip stitched video)  
**Platforms:** TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels  
**Concept:** Concept 07 - UGC Fisherman Testimonial

**Note:** This script uses three clips (10s + 15s + 15s) that will be stitched together in CapCut for a 40-second total video.

## Clip 1 – The Hook: The Mistake

### Hook line

"Most walleye anglers check their bite window when they get to the water. That's already too late."

### Sora prompt (Clip 1)

"Vertical selfie video filmed on a phone. A mid-20s to mid-30s fisherman wearing a hoodie and beanie is standing on a boat ramp or shore with a lake in the background, fishing gear visible nearby (tackle box, rods, boat or kayak). It should feel like real TikTok UGC: slight phone shake, natural outdoor lighting (dawn or early morning), and phone-mic audio.

He talks directly to the camera with a knowing, slightly urgent tone and says: 'Most walleye anglers check their bite window when they get to the water. That's already too late. By the time you're launching your boat, you've already missed your chance to adjust your timing.'

Keep his delivery conversational and direct, like he's sharing a critical insight. Include subtle ambient outdoor sounds (water, birds, wind). Leave clean space in the upper-right corner so I can add a screenshot overlay later."

### Sora clip length and orientation
- Orientation: Portrait
- Length: 10 seconds
(These are set in the Sora UI, not in the prompt text.)

### Character creation note
- Create the character in Sora 2 for Clip 1. Save/reference this character for use in Clips 2 and 3.

## Clip 2 – The Tip: Check Before You Leave

### Hook / continuation

"Here's what I do instead..."

### Character consistency
- **Use the same character created in Clip 1** - In Sora 2, select/reference the character from Clip 1 to maintain consistency across clips.

### Sora prompt (Clip 2)

"Vertical selfie video filmed on a phone. Same fisherman, now sitting in a kayak or small boat at the shore, or standing on the dock with water in the background, holding his phone and looking at it. Fishing gear is visible around him. It should feel like authentic TikTok UGC: slight shake, natural outdoor lighting (dawn or early morning), phone-mic audio.

He actively speaks to camera, speaking clearly with natural hand gestures. He holds the phone up slightly while speaking. He says with a calm, educational tone: 'Here's what I do instead. Before I even grab my gear, I check when the bite window actually starts. Sometimes it's 5:30 AM, sometimes it's 6:45. If the window doesn't open until 7, why am I launching at 5? I check my phone first, then I plan my whole morning around that window.'

Keep his delivery genuine and practical—like he's sharing a real time-saver. Include natural audio of his voice and subtle outdoor sounds (water, birds). Leave clean space in the upper-right corner so I can add a screenshot overlay later."

### Sora clip length and orientation
- Orientation: Portrait
- Length: 15 seconds
(These are set in the Sora UI, not in the prompt text.)

## Clip 3 – The Payoff: Results & AI Acknowledgment

### Hook / continuation

"And honestly? It's been a game-changer."

### Character consistency
- **Use the same character created in Clip 1** - In Sora 2, select/reference the character from Clip 1 to maintain consistency across clips.

### Sora prompt (Clip 3)

"Vertical selfie video filmed on a phone. Same fisherman, now in his boat at dawn, holding a nice walleye. It should feel like real TikTok UGC: slight phone shake, natural morning light, and phone-mic audio.

He actively speaks to camera and says: 'And honestly? It's been a game-changer. I show up when the window says to show up, not when I think I should. Oh, and just so you know—we use AI to make these videos, but the PrimeBite app? That's 100% real. The bite times actually work, and it's all research-backed data. Try it yourself and you'll see.'

Keep his delivery genuine and transparent, like he's being honest with a friend. Include subtle water sounds. Leave clean space in the upper-right corner so I can add a screenshot overlay later."

### Sora clip length and orientation
- Orientation: Portrait
- Length: 15 seconds

## Stitching Instructions

1. Generate Clip 1 in Sora 2 (10 seconds, portrait orientation)
2. Generate Clip 2 in Sora 2 (15 seconds, portrait orientation, using same character as Clip 1)
3. Generate Clip 3 in Sora 2 (15 seconds, portrait orientation, using same character as Clip 1)
4. Export all three clips
5. Import all three clips into CapCut
6. Stitch Clip 1, Clip 2, and Clip 3 together in sequence (Clip 1 → Clip 2 → Clip 3)
7. Add screenshot overlay during Clip 2 and Clip 3 (see overlay notes below)
8. Final video length: 40 seconds total (10s + 15s + 15s)

## Overlay / screenshot notes (CapCut)

**Clip 1 (0-10s):** No overlay needed - let the hook land first

**Clip 2 (10-25s):** 
- Use Today Tab bite-window screenshot (Screenshot #1 from reference)
- Crop to show just the bite windows card with times and ratings
- Size: ~25-30% of screen width
- Position: top-right corner
- Show from 13s to 24s (when he mentions "check when the bite window actually starts" and shows examples of different times)
- Fade in at 13s (0.3s), fade out at 24s (0.3s)
- Optional small text under screenshot: "check before you leave"

**Clip 3 (25-40s):** 
- Show the same bite-window screenshot again
- Highlight or point to the specific window time that matches what he says (e.g., if he says "6:20", show a window that includes that time)
- Size: ~25-30% of screen width
- Position: top-right corner
- Show from 28s to 38s (when he mentions the specific time "6:20" and "right when the app said")
- Fade in at 28s (0.3s), fade out at 38s (0.3s)

**Total video length:** 40 seconds (10s + 15s + 15s)

## Performance notes

(To be filled in later in analytics/shorts-log.csv once view/like data is available.)

**Testing focus:** This script tests a practical, actionable tip format that emphasizes planning and timing optimization. The hook addresses a common mistake (checking timing too late), provides a clear solution (check before leaving), and shows payoff. This format should be highly shareable as it's immediately actionable advice that viewers can apply to their own fishing routine.

**AI Acknowledgment:** Clip 3 includes AI acknowledgment integrated naturally at the end, emphasizing that:
1. The video is AI-generated (transparency)
2. The PrimeBite app is real
3. The bite times actually work
4. It's all research-backed data

This addresses viewer concerns about AI-generated content while maintaining trust in the product itself.

**Key differentiators from other scripts:**
- Focuses on pre-trip planning rather than on-water technique
- Emphasizes time optimization and efficiency
- Three-clip format allows for problem → solution → payoff narrative arc
- Practical, actionable advice that's easy to remember and share
- Includes AI transparency acknowledgment in final clip
