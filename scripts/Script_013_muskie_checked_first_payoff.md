# Script 013 – Muskie Success (Checked First, Finally Got One) - Two-Clip Stitched

**Species:** Muskie (Muskellunge)  
**Style:** UGC tip (Clip 1) + payoff (Clip 2)  
**Platforms:** TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels  

## Video title / caption

**Title / Caption:**  
"I checked first. Then finally caught a muskie. 🎣"

## Clip 1 – Morning check before leaving

### Hook line

"Here's what I started doing before every muskie trip."

### Sora prompt (Clip 1)

"Vertical selfie video filmed on a phone. A mid-20s to mid-30s fisherman wearing a hoodie and beanie is in his truck cab at dawn, soft morning light coming through windshield. It should feel like real TikTok UGC: slight phone shake, natural lighting, and phone-mic audio.

He speaks to the camera with a casual, almost confessional tone, like sharing a discovery. He says something like: 'Here's what I started doing before every muskie trip. I check this little window chart while I'm drinking coffee. Shows me when the bite's actually gonna turn on. So I'm not out there at six AM throwing for hours at nothing.'

Keep his delivery relaxed and genuine, like talking to a buddy, not pitching anything. Include subtle truck cab sounds (maybe coffee sipping, seat adjustment). Leave clean space in the upper-right area so I can add a small graphic later."

### Sora clip length
- Length: 10 seconds
- Orientation: Portrait

## Clip 2 – Payoff / Results

### Hook / continuation

"So I showed up right when the window hit…"

### Sora prompt (Clip 2)

"Vertical selfie video filmed on a phone. Same fisherman, now in a boat during daytime, holding a nice muskie horizontally with both hands (one hand under head, one hand under tail, fish stretched horizontally). It should feel like raw TikTok UGC: slight shake, natural outdoor lighting, and phone-mic audio.

He holds the muskie with a huge satisfied smile and talks to the camera in an excited but genuine tone. He says something like: 'So I showed up right when the window hit and… yeah. Thirty-eight inches. First cast during the window. That little timing chart? This is the third time it's been spot on.'

Keep his reaction genuine and excited but not overacted. Include subtle water sounds, maybe a boat rocking. Leave clean space in the upper-right corner so I can add a small graphic later."

### Sora clip length

## Clip 3 – AI Transparency Acknowledgment

### Hook / continuation

"Oh, and real quick…"

### Sora prompt (Clip 3)

"Vertical selfie video filmed on a phone. Same fisherman, still in the boat, casual and relaxed. It should feel like raw TikTok UGC: slight shake, natural outdoor lighting, and phone-mic audio.

He looks directly at the camera with a genuine, straightforward expression and says something like: 'Oh, and real quick—yeah, we use AI to make these videos. But the PrimeBite bite windows and timing? That's 100% real data. The app shows you exactly how we calculate everything—full research document, technical appendix, all our sources. It's all there. The app doesn't lie. Try it yourself.'

Keep his delivery authentic and transparent, not defensive. Brief and matter-of-fact, like casually addressing the obvious. Include subtle water sounds. Leave clean space in the upper-right corner so I can add a small graphic later."

## Strategy notes

- Three-clip stitched format (extends Script 004's two-clip success with AI transparency)
- Tip + payoff + transparency structure
- Different species (muskie) to diversify content - appeals to trophy fish anglers
- Before/during/closer structure creates complete narrative arc
- Different setting variation (truck cab → boat) adds visual interest
- "Checked first" = emphasizes planning/strategy angle
- "Finally got one" = muskie are notoriously hard to catch, makes success more dramatic
- Results shown visually (holding muskie properly) = tangible proof
- Specified both-hands horizontal hold based on Script 007 lessons (avoids fake-looking one-handed hold)
- **Clip 3 AI transparency:** Proactively addresses AI concerns, emphasizes real PrimeBite data (per AI Transparency Strategy in SORA_2_REFERENCE.md)
- Total 30 seconds allows for complete story + transparency without feeling rushed
