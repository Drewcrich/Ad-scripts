## Sora prompt

"Vertical selfie video filmed on a phone. A mid-20s to mid-30s fisherman wearing a hoodie and beanie is sitting in his boat at night with a soft headlamp glow. It should feel like real TikTok UGC: slight phone shake, natural low-light noise, and phone-mic audio.

He speaks quietly but clearly to the camera and says something like: 'If you fish walleye at night, here's the little routine that works for me. I kill the noise, drag a jig stupid slow along the break, and before I even launch I check a simple timing chart so I'm not just guessing.'

Keep his delivery calm and confident, like he's giving a genuine tip, not an ad. Include subtle water and boat sounds. Leave some clean space in the upper-right area of the frame so I can add a small graphic later."

## Overlay / screenshot notes (CapCut)

- Use Today-tab bite-window screenshot, cropped to just the black card with times and ratings.  
- Add as an overlay in CapCut, not in Sora.  
- Size: ~25–30% of screen width.  
- Position: top-right corner.  
- Show roughly from 6s to 10s with a short fade in/out (0.2–0.3s).  
- Optional small text under it: `my timing chart`.  
- No big "PrimeBite" logo or CTA on screen; this video is content-first.
