## STORYBOARD 1 – The Split-Screen Contrast (15 seconds, 2 scenes)

**Vision:** Side-by-side split screen showing dramatic contrast. Left = failure, Right = success. NO dialogue during this part - just text overlays and music. The visual contrast is the hook.

**📋 PASTE FROM HERE ↓**

Vertical split-screen storyboard, 2 scenes, 15 seconds total. No dialogue. Dramatic music plays throughout.

Scene 1 (8s):

LEFT SIDE: A fisherman on a boat at 2 PM in harsh midday sun. He's sitting, looking bored and frustrated. His rod is idle in a holder. No action. He checks his watch, shakes his head. Calm water, no bites.

RIGHT SIDE: Same fisherman on same boat at 7 PM in golden hour light. He's actively fishing, rod bent, clearly fighting something. Water splashing. Excited body language.

Text overlay appears at 1s on LEFT: "2:00 PM" | Text overlay appears at 1s on RIGHT: "7:00 PM"

Scene 2 (7s):

LEFT SIDE: Same fisherman reeling in slowly, pulls up an empty line. Disappointment on his face. He shrugs. No fish.

RIGHT SIDE: Same fisherman reeling in, a large walleye comes into frame at the boat. He's pumped, reaching for the net. Success.

Text overlay appears at 9s on LEFT: "3 Hours. Nothing." | Text overlay appears at 9s on RIGHT: "20 Minutes. THIS."

## CLIP 2 – The Reveal: Why It Happened (10 seconds)

**📋 PASTE FROM HERE ↓**

Vertical selfie video filmed on a phone. Same fisherman on boat at golden hour (7 PM setting). He looks directly at camera with satisfied, knowing expression.

He speaks: "Same day. Same lake. Same lures. The ONLY difference? I fished the bite window at seven PM. Not whenever I felt like it."

Upbeat background music plays (lower volume so his voice is clear). Leave clean space in top-right corner for overlay.

**↑ TO HERE 📋**

**Duration:** 10 seconds | **Orientation:** Portrait

**Character Note:** Create character in Sora 2. Use same character across storyboard and clips.

**Dialogue Word Count:** 27 words (within 30-word limit for 10s)

## CLIP 3 – AI Transparency & CTA (10 seconds)

**📋 PASTE FROM HERE ↓**

Vertical selfie video filmed on a phone. Same fisherman on boat, holding the walleye from the right side of split screen.

He speaks: "This video is AI-generated, but that seven PM window? That's real PrimeBite data. Stop fishing randomly. Fish the windows. Check PrimeBite."

Soft background music plays (lower volume so his voice is clear). Leave clean space in top-right corner for overlay.

**↑ TO HERE 📋**

**Duration:** 10 seconds | **Orientation:** Portrait

**Character Note:** Use same character from Storyboard 1.

**Dialogue Word Count:** 28 words (within 30-word limit for 10s)

## CapCut Instructions

### Storyboard 1 (0-15s):

**CRITICAL FOR RETENTION:**

- The split screen MUST be immediately visible at 0 seconds
- No fade-in, no intro - straight into the contrast
- Music should start LOUD and dramatic

**Music:**

- Use dramatic, building music (tension → resolution style)
- High energy from start
- Volume: Loud (no dialogue to compete with)

**Text Overlays (ESSENTIAL FOR RETENTION):**

- **At 0s (immediate):**
  - Large text top-center: "SAME DAY. SAME LAKE."
  - Display from 0s to 3s, then fade out
  - Font: Bold, white text with black outline, LARGE size
  - This is the hook - it must be visible immediately

- **At 1s:**
  - LEFT SIDE: "2:00 PM" (small text, top-left corner)
  - RIGHT SIDE: "7:00 PM" (small text, top-right corner)
  - Display throughout Scene 1 (until 8s)

- **At 9s:**
  - LEFT SIDE: "3 Hours. Nothing." (center-left)
  - RIGHT SIDE: "20 Minutes. THIS." (center-right)
  - Font: Bold, larger text
  - Display from 9s to 15s

**Split Screen Technical:**

- Perfect vertical split down the center
- Left and right sides should be perfectly synchronized in timing
- Both sides visible at all times (never full screen either side)

### Clip 2 (15-25s):

**Screenshot Overlay:**

- Use Today Tab bite-window screenshot
- Show from 17s to 24s
- Highlight the 7:00 PM window
- Size: ~30-35% of screen width
- Position: top-right corner
- Fade in at 17s (0.3s), fade out at 24s (0.3s)

**Text Overlay:**

- At 19s: "🎯 7:00 PM = PRIME WINDOW"
- Display from 19s to 23s
- Position: Lower-third, center

### Clip 3 (25-35s):

**Text Overlays:**

- At 26s: "🤖 AI-Generated Video"
- At 28s: "✅ Real Bite Windows"
- At 31s: "📱 Download PrimeBite"
- Font: Bold, white text with black outline
- Position: Center-bottom

**Screenshot Overlay:**

- Show small Today Tab screenshot in top-right corner from 28s-34s
- Size: ~25-30% of screen width
- Fade in at 28s (0.3s), fade out at 34s (0.3s)

### Stitching:

- Import Storyboard 1 (15s) and Clips 2-3 (10s each)
- Stitch in sequence: Storyboard 1 → Clip 2 → Clip 3
- **CRITICAL:** No fade-in on Storyboard 1 - it must start immediately
- Add 0.2s crossfade transitions between Storyboard 1 → Clip 2 and Clip 2 → Clip 3
- Add dramatic music to Storyboard 1 (full volume, no dialogue)
- Lower music volume during Clips 2-3 so dialogue is clear
- Add all text overlays as specified (the "SAME DAY. SAME LAKE." hook is CRITICAL)
- Ensure split screen is perfectly centered and synchronized
- Export vertical 9:16, 1080x1920 resolution

**Total Video Length:** 35 seconds (15s + 10s + 10s)

### 0-3 seconds (THE HOOK):

- **Visual:** Immediate split screen (no fade-in)
- **Text:** "SAME DAY. SAME LAKE." appears instantly
- **Music:** Dramatic, loud, building tension

### 3-8 seconds (BUILD CONTRAST):

- **Left:** Bored fisherman, no action, harsh light
- **Right:** Active fisherman, bent rod, golden light
- **Text:** "2:00 PM" vs "7:00 PM" labels
- **Why it works:** Visual contrast keeps attention, viewers want to see outcome

### 8-15 seconds (PROGRESSIVE REVEAL):

- **Left:** Empty line reveal (disappointment)
- **Right:** Fish reveal (success)
- **Text:** "3 Hours. Nothing." vs "20 Minutes. THIS."
- **Why it works:** Payoff moment, validates the contrast, satisfying resolution

### 15-25 seconds (EXPLANATION):

- **Visual:** Single camera, fisherman explains
- **Screenshot:** Bite window appears
- **Text:** "7:00 PM = PRIME WINDOW"
- **Why it works:** Now they NEED to know how he knew, screenshot provides proof

### 25-35 seconds (TRANSPARENCY + CTA):

- **Visual:** Fisherman holding fish
- **Text:** AI disclosure + CTA
- **Screenshot:** App visible
- **Why it works:** Maintained engagement through to CTA, fish shot keeps attention

## 📊 Why This Will Have High Retention

### Retention Hooks:

- **Immediate visual contrast** - No intro, straight into the difference
- **No explanation needed** - Visual proof speaks for itself
- **Progressive reveals** - Don't show everything at once (empty line vs fish)
- **Curiosity gap** - "Why is one side working and not the other?"
- **Emotional contrast** - Frustration (left) vs excitement (right)
- **Text reinforcement** - Key points emphasized without dialogue
- **Satisfying payoff** - The reveal at 8s delivers on the promise
- **Education moment** - Explanation comes after they're hooked
- **Fish shot finale** - Holding the actual fish validates everything

### Pattern Interrupts:

- Split screen format (unusual for fishing content)
- Side-by-side comparison (instant understanding)
- No dialogue in first 15s (music + visuals only)
- Text-driven storytelling (modern TikTok style)

---

## Performance Predictions

### Expected Performance:

- **Target views:** 3,000+ (visual format = higher shareability)
- **Target retention:** 70%+ (24s+ avg watch time)
- **Target shares:** High (comparison format is inherently shareable)
- **Target saves:** High ("I need to show this to my buddy")

### Why This Will Outperform:

✅ Instant hook - No wasted seconds  
✅ Visual proof - Shows don't tell  
✅ Pattern interrupt - Split screen is different  
✅ No explanation needed - Anyone can understand  
✅ Highly shareable - "Look at this difference!"  
✅ Tag-worthy - People will tag friends who fish randomly  
✅ Educational - But only after they're hooked  
✅ Satisfying - Progressive reveal structure

## 🎬 Production Notes

### For Sora Generation:

**Storyboard Critical Success Factors:**

- Character consistency - Same person, same boat, same everything except time/light
- Lighting contrast - Harsh midday (left) vs golden hour (right) is crucial
- Action contrast - Idle/bored (left) vs active/excited (right)
- Synchronization - Both sides must match in timing for split screen to work
- Clear results - Empty line (left) vs fish (right) must be obvious

**If Sora Struggles:**

- Generate left side and right side as separate storyboards
- Stitch them together in CapCut using split-screen effect
- This gives you more control over each side

### Visual Contrast Checklist:

**Left Side (2 PM - Wrong Time):**

☐ Harsh, flat midday lighting  
☐ Calm, boring water  
☐ Idle rod in holder  
☐ Bored, frustrated body language  
☐ Checking watch, shaking head  
☐ Empty line reveal  
☐ Disappointment

**Right Side (7 PM - Bite Window):**

☐ Golden hour warm lighting  
☐ Active water (splashing)  
☐ Bent rod, fighting fish  
☐ Excited, engaged body language  
☐ Reaching for net  
☐ Fish reveal  
☐ Success/celebration

## Strategic Notes

### Why Split-Screen Format Works:

- Instant understanding - No explanation needed
- Visual proof - Shows actual difference
- Shareability - "Check out this comparison!"
- Memorable - Format sticks in mind
- Comparison bias - Humans love before/after
- Tag mechanics - "This is you vs this is me"

### Content Mix:

- UGC format (maintaining 70% UGC / 30% Cinematic ratio)
- Concept 07 (UGC Fisherman Testimonial) with visual innovation

### If This Performs Well:

- Create more split-screen comparisons
- Test different contrasts (morning vs night, calm vs windy, etc.)
- Apply format to other species

### If This Underperforms:

- May indicate format is too different from proven style
- Return to talking-head testimonial format
- Keep split-screen concept but simplify execution

---

## 📱 Mobile Optimization

**Critical for Vertical Video:**

- Split screen should be perfectly centered
- Text should be large enough to read on phone
- Both sides should be clearly visible (not too squished)
- Fish reveal should be obvious even on small screen
- Screenshot overlay should not cover split-screen content

---
