## Clip 1 – The Hook: Snagged... Then It Moves (15 seconds)

**📋 PASTE FROM HERE ↓**

Vertical handheld video filmed on a phone. Night ice fishing scene. Five people around a glowing ice hole wearing heavy winter coats and headlamps. One guy holds a rod that's bent down into the hole—hasn't moved for several seconds. Someone says "You're snagged, dude." Then suddenly the rod PULLS hard. Everyone reacts—"WHOA!" "IT MOVED!" Chaos erupts.

The main fisherman (filming earlier) speaks over the chaos: "We thought he was snagged on the bottom. Then it moved. Everyone grab a light—this thing is HUGE."

Raw UGC feel: shaky camera, headlamp lighting, excited voices. Dramatic tension music plays (building intensity).

## Clip 2 – The Reveal: Monster Walleye (10 seconds)

**📋 PASTE FROM HERE ↓**

Vertical handheld video filmed on a phone. Same ice scene. A massive walleye comes through the hole—thick-bodied, over 30 inches. The five people erupt—yelling, high-fiving, everyone talking at once. Someone holds it up: "THIRTY-TWO INCHES!"

Raw chaos energy. Headlamps illuminating the fish. Triumphant music plays.

## Clip 3 – AI Disclosure + Natural Context (10 seconds)

**📋 PASTE FROM HERE ↓**

Vertical selfie video filmed on a phone. Same fisherman, now calmer, still on the ice. Holding the walleye.

He speaks: "We almost left at nine PM. Window said ten to midnight. Showed up at nine-forty-five. This hit at ten-oh-eight. Quick note: AI video, real bite data. Check PrimeBite."

Soft background music plays (lower volume so his voice is clear). Leave clean space in top-right corner for overlay.
