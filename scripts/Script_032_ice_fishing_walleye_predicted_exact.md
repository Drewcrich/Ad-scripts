## Clip 1 – Pre-Catch Setup with App Check (15 seconds)

📋 PASTE FROM HERE ↓

Vertical selfie video filmed on a phone. A mid-30s fisherman wearing heavy winter parka and beanie kneels beside an ice hole on a frozen lake. Bright afternoon sun. Ice auger and fishing gear visible nearby.

He speaks with excited anticipation: "Alright, it's 2:28 PM right now. PrimeBite says the bite window opens at 2:30 exactly. Mid-afternoon walleye through the ice. Let's see if this thing actually works."

He drops his line down the ice hole.

Upbeat background music plays (lower volume so his voice is clear). Include ambient sounds (wind, ice cracking). Leave clean space in top-right corner for overlay.

## Clip 2 – THE STRIKE (7 seconds)

📋 PASTE FROM HERE ↓

Vertical video filmed on a phone. Medium close-up of fisherman from chest to head. He's kneeling on ice. His hands are down at his waist holding something (rod handle barely visible at very bottom edge of frame).

Suddenly he jerks backward with his whole upper body. His arms pull up toward his chest. His face shows shock and excitement.

He yells: "THERE IT IS! It hit at EXACTLY 2:30!"

Epic action music plays. Include ambient sounds (yelling).

Duration: 7 seconds | Orientation: Portrait
