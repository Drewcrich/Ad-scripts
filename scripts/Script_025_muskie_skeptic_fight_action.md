# Script 025 – Muskie: "I Thought It Was BS" (Action Close-Ups)

**Species:** Muskie  
**Style:** Action/Irony (Trash-talking the app while it works)  
**Platforms:** TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels  
**Concept:** High-intensity close-ups to hide Sora's physics limitations. The narrative arc is irony: he's complaining about the app's prediction *while* fighting the massive fish it predicted.

## STORYBOARD 1 – The Hookset & Fight (15 seconds total)

**Total Duration:** 15 seconds (Scene 1: 5s + Scene 2: 10s = 15s total)

**Vision:** Medium close-up framing shows fishing context (boat, rod handle, water) while keeping the rod tip out of frame to avoid physics issues. Pure reaction to the strike and the fight.

**Note:** Generate as a 2-scene storyboard in Sora. Copy Scene 1 prompt and Scene 2 prompt separately into the storyboard.

### STORYBOARD 1 - SCENE 1 (5 seconds - Part 1 of 15s storyboard)

**📋 COPY SCENE 1 FROM HERE ↓**

Vertical storyboard scene, 5 seconds. Medium close-up on a mid-30s fisherman's upper body (chest to head). He's sitting on a boat, holding a fishing rod with both hands. The rod handle and reel are visible in the lower portion of the frame. Mid-day sun, bright blue sky and water visible in background. He looks bored, tired, almost falling asleep.

He speaks to camera: "I honestly thought this app was a gimmick..."

Suddenly—BAM. He jerks back violently (setting the hook). Eyes go wide with shock. He grunts with effort. The rod handle moves with his body, but the rod tip extends out of frame above.

### STORYBOARD 1 - SCENE 2 (10 seconds - Part 2 of 15s storyboard)

**📋 COPY SCENE 2 FROM HERE ↓**

Vertical storyboard scene, 10 seconds. Medium close-up on his upper body and face (chest to head, profile view). He's standing now, holding the fishing rod with both hands. The rod handle and reel are visible, but the rod tip extends out of frame. He is straining hard, looking down at the water. Shoulders and arms twisting as he reels. Sweat on his forehead. Boat deck and water visible in background.

He speaks while fighting, breathless and straining: "It said the bite window was 2 PM. In full sun. Who catches Muskie at 2 PM?"

Intense focus and physical effort. Heavy breathing audible.

**Total Duration:** 15 seconds (Scene 1: 8s + Scene 2: 7s = 15s total)

**Vision:** Medium close-up continues showing the fight. Rod handle visible, but tip extends out of frame. Boat and water context clear. Exhausted but locked in.

### STORYBOARD 2 - SCENE 1 (8 seconds - Part 1 of 15s storyboard)

**📋 COPY SCENE 1 FROM HERE ↓**

Vertical storyboard scene, 8 seconds. Medium close-up on his upper body and face (chest to head). He's standing on the boat, actively fighting a fish. He's holding the fishing rod with both hands, and the rod is being pulled and bent by the fish—the rod handle and reel are visible in frame, but the rod tip extends upward out of frame and is clearly under tension. He's constantly moving: pumping the rod up and down, reeling in, then the fish pulls back and he has to give line. His arms and shoulders are in constant motion—pulling, reeling, fighting. Sweat dripping. Teeth gritted. He's clearly struggling against a strong fish. Boat deck and water visible in background. Blue sky and bright sun above.

He speaks while actively fighting, heavy breathing between words, never stopping the fight: "I told my buddy this was a waste of gas... [heavy breathing]... I said apps are for people who can't fish."

The fight continues throughout—he's reeling, the rod is bending, he's straining. This is an active, ongoing battle.

### STORYBOARD 2 - SCENE 2 (7 seconds - Part 2 of 15s storyboard)

**📋 COPY SCENE 2 FROM HERE ↓**

Vertical storyboard scene, 7 seconds. Medium close-up on his upper body and face (chest to head, side profile). He's still actively fighting the fish—holding the rod with both hands, the rod is bent and under tension, he's reeling in, the fish is still pulling. The fight is ongoing. He's straining, muscles tense, but the strain on his face breaks into a massive, shocked smile as he realizes the fish is coming in. He laughs in disbelief while still fighting. The rod is still bent, he's still reeling, the battle continues. Boat deck and water clearly visible in background.

He speaks, still breathless and still fighting, with growing realization: "But I think I might be eating my words right now."

The fight continues throughout—he's actively reeling, the rod is still bent, he's still working to bring the fish in.

The app rates each window so you know which ones are worth your time. Every calculation is backed by published research—all sources are in the app. PrimeBite on the App Store."

## CapCut Instructions

**Stitching:**
1. **Storyboard 1 (0-13s):** Start with the bored face, let the "BAM" hookset hit hard on the beat if using music. *(Note: Last 2 seconds cut due to physics issues)*
2. **Storyboard 2 (13-28s):** Cut straight to the struggle. The continuity of effort is key.
3. **Clip 3 (28-38s):** The reveal. Show the fish immediately.
4. **Clip 4 (38-53s):** The honest close with app details.

**Total Video Length:** 53 seconds (13s + 15s + 10s + 15s)

**Overlays:**
- **Storyboard 1 (5-12s):**
  - **Text:** "2:00 PM - Full Sun ☀️" (emphasizing the 'wrong' time)
  - **Style:** White text, bold, slight shadow. Top center.
  - **Note:** Fade out before 13s since last 2 seconds were cut
- **Storyboard 2 (18-28s):**
  - **Screenshot:** **Today Tab** showing the "Minor Window" or specific peak at 2 PM.
  - **Animation:** Slide in from right.
  - **Text:** "App said: 2:00 PM Window" pointing to the graph.
- **Clip 4 (38-53s):**
  - **Overlay:** Rotate through multiple screenshots:
    - **0-5s (38-43s):** **Today Tab (Bite Windows)** - "Shows you when fish bite"
    - **5-10s (43-48s):** **Research & Sources** screenshot - "Backed by peer-reviewed research"
    - **10-15s (48-53s):** **Technical Appendix** or **Activity Timeline** - "Real science, real data"
  - **Text Overlay:**
    - At 40s: "🤖 AI-Generated Video"
    - At 43s: "✅ Real Bite Windows"
    - At 46s: "🔬 Peer-Reviewed Research"
    - At 50s: "📱 Download PrimeBite"

**Audio Strategy:**
- **SFX:** Enhance the *whoosh* of the hookset. Add heavy breathing and straining sounds during the fight clips (Sora might generate some, but layer more in CapCut).
- **Music:** Start with something low/boring (0-4s), then **DROP** into high-intensity action music at the hookset. Cut the music for the Payoff (Clip 3) to let the relief land.

## Title/Caption

**Title:** "The app said 2 PM. I said it was crazy. 🎣🤯 #muskie #fishing"
