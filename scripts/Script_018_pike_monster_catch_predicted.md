## Testing Focus

This script tests:
1. **Visual action throughout** - Not just talking, but casting, fighting, revealing
2. **Specific time prediction** - "7:23 AM exactly" creates testable claim
3. **High energy + excitement** - Explosive reactions, yelling, celebration
4. **Record-sized fish** - 42-inch pike is trophy size
5. **App as hero** - Emphasizes app predicted EXACTLY when fish would bite
6. **Northern Pike** - First pike epic moment (vs. educational tip)
7. **Proof-based narrative** - Setup → Prediction → Exact fulfillment → Proof
8. **4-clip format** - Longer narrative arc (50s total)

**Hypothesis:** High visual action + specific time prediction + massive fish = high engagement. "Exact time" narrative creates credibility and shareability. Epic moment format works for freshwater (not just offshore like Script 007). Proof-based structure ("I'm testing this" → "It worked!") builds trust.
