## Clip 1 – The Timing Tip

### Hook line

"If you're showing up to fish walleye at the same time every weekend, you're probably missing the best bite."

### Sora prompt (Clip 1)

"Vertical selfie video filmed on a phone. A mid-20s to mid-30s fisherman wearing a hoodie and beanie is sitting in his boat at dawn, with soft morning light in the background. It should feel like real TikTok UGC: slight phone shake, natural lighting, and phone-mic audio.

He talks directly to the camera with a knowing, conversational tone and says: 'If you're showing up to fish walleye at the same time every weekend, you're probably missing the best bite. I used to do the same thing—roll up at 6 AM every Saturday thinking that was the magic hour. But the bite windows change every single day based on moon position, and I was just guessing.'

Keep his delivery calm and relatable, like he's sharing a lesson learned. Include subtle ambient morning sounds (water, distant birds). Leave clean space in the upper-right corner so I can add a screenshot overlay later."

### Sora clip length and orientation
- Orientation: Portrait
- Length: 15 seconds
(These are set in the Sora UI, not in the prompt text.)

### Character creation note
- Create the character in Sora 2 for Clip 1. Save/reference this character for use in Clips 2 and 3.

## Clip 2 – The Solution

### Hook / continuation

"Now I check my PrimeBite window before I even leave the house..."

### Character consistency
- **Use the same character created in Clip 1** - In Sora 2, select/reference the character from Clip 1 to maintain consistency across clips.

### Sora prompt (Clip 2)

"Vertical selfie video filmed on a phone. Same fisherman, now holding a nice walleye up to the camera with both hands, still in the boat at dawn. It should feel like authentic TikTok UGC: slight shake, natural morning light, phone-mic audio.

He actively speaks to camera, speaking clearly with lip sync and hand gestures. He holds the fish up while speaking. He says with a relaxed, matter-of-fact tone: 'Now I check my PrimeBite window before I even leave the house, and I show up when it says the bite is actually going to be hot. This one hit at 5:45 AM, exactly when the window said it would be active. No more guessing, no more wasted trips.'

Keep his delivery genuine and confident—like he's sharing a real game-changer. Include natural audio of his voice and subtle water sounds. Leave clean space in the upper-right corner so I can add a screenshot overlay later."

### Sora clip length and orientation
- Orientation: Portrait
- Length: 15 seconds
(These are set in the Sora UI, not in the prompt text.)

## Clip 3 – AI Acknowledgment & App Validation

### Hook / continuation

"Oh, and just so you know..."

### Character consistency
- **Use the same character created in Clip 1** - In Sora 2, select/reference the character from Clip 1 to maintain consistency across clips.

### Sora prompt (Clip 3)

"Vertical selfie video filmed on a phone. Same fisherman, still in the boat at dawn, now speaking directly to camera without holding the fish. It should feel like authentic TikTok UGC: slight shake, natural morning light, phone-mic audio.

He actively speaks to camera with a transparent, honest tone at a natural, conversational pace. He says: 'Oh, and just so you know—we use AI to make these videos, but the PrimeBite app? That's 100% real. The bite times actually work, and it's all research-backed data. Try it yourself and you'll see.'

Keep his delivery genuine and transparent—like he's being honest with a friend. He should look directly at the camera with a calm, trustworthy expression. Speak at a natural pace that fits comfortably in 10 seconds without feeling rushed. Include natural audio of his voice and subtle water sounds. Leave clean space in the upper-right corner so I can add a screenshot overlay later if needed."

### Sora clip length and orientation
- Orientation: Portrait
- Length: 10 seconds
(These are set in the Sora UI, not in the prompt text.)

## Overlay / screenshot notes (CapCut)

**Clip 1 (0-15s):** No overlay needed - let the hook land first

**Clip 2 (15-30s):** 
- Use Today Tab bite-window screenshot (Screenshot #1 from reference)
- Crop to show just the bite windows card with times and ratings
- Size: ~25-30% of screen width
- Position: top-right corner
- Show from 17s to 27s (when he mentions "check my PrimeBite window" and "exactly when the window said")
- Fade in at 17s (0.3s), fade out at 27s (0.3s)
- Optional small text under screenshot: "my bite window"

**Clip 3 (30-40s):** No overlay needed - let the AI acknowledgment message land clearly

**Total video length:** 40 seconds (15s + 15s + 10s)

## Performance notes

(To be filled in later in analytics/shorts-log.csv once view/like data is available.)

**Testing focus:** This script tests the inclusion of AI acknowledgment in the voiceover. The acknowledgment is integrated naturally at the end, emphasizing that:
1. The video is AI-generated (transparency)
2. The PrimeBite app is real
3. The bite times actually work
4. It's all research-backed data

This addresses viewer concerns about AI-generated content while maintaining trust in the product itself.
