# Script 010 – Walleye: I Fished at the Wrong Time (Three-clip contrast video)

**Species:** Walleye  
**Style:** UGC confession/contrast story (three-clip stitched video)  
**Platforms:** TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels  
**Concept:** Concept 07 - UGC Fisherman Testimonial

**Creative Twist:** This script uses **visual and emotional contrast** to show the dramatic difference between fishing at the wrong time (slow, boring, frustrating) versus fishing during the actual bite window (action-packed, exciting). The confession format makes it more relatable and entertaining than typical "here's a tip" videos. The four-clip structure keeps dialogue manageable and ensures the AI transparency message doesn't get cut off.

**Note:** This script uses four clips (15s + 12s + 10s + 10s) that will be stitched together in CapCut for a 47-second total video.

## Clip 1 – The Wrong Time: Frustration & Boredom

### Hook line

"I spent three hours on the water yesterday and caught absolutely nothing. Wanna know why?"

### Sora prompt (Clip 1)

"Vertical selfie video filmed on a phone. A mid-20s to mid-30s fisherman wearing a hoodie and beanie is sitting in a small boat or kayak on a lake during mid-afternoon (harsh, flat daylight). He looks tired and slightly frustrated. It should feel like real TikTok UGC: slight phone shake, natural lighting, phone-mic audio.

He talks to camera with a defeated, honest tone and says: 'I spent three hours on the water yesterday and caught absolutely nothing. Wanna know why? Because I showed up at 2 PM. Just... whenever I felt like it.'

Behind him, his fishing rod sits idle in a rod holder - no action, no bites. Keep his delivery genuine and self-aware, like he's admitting a rookie mistake. Include ambient water sounds and boat creaks. Leave clean space in the upper-right corner so I can add a screenshot overlay later."

### Sora clip length and orientation
- Orientation: Portrait
- Length: 15 seconds
(These are set in the Sora UI, not in the prompt text.)

## Clip 2 – The Realization: The Mistake Revealed

### Hook / continuation

"So I checked PrimeBite when I got home..."

### Character consistency
- **Use the same character created in Clip 1** - In Sora 2, select/reference the character from Clip 1 to maintain consistency across clips.

### Sora prompt (Clip 2)

"Vertical selfie video filmed on a phone. Same fisherman, now sitting in his truck at dusk (interior of truck cab, fishing gear visible on the passenger seat or in background). He talks directly to camera with frustrated, self-deprecating body language - shaking his head, maybe putting a hand to his forehead, leaning back in the seat with disbelief. It should feel like authentic TikTok UGC: slight shake, natural vehicle interior lighting, phone-mic audio.

He actively speaks to camera with an 'I can't believe I did this' tone and says: 'So I checked PrimeBite when I got home. The bite window? 7:15 to 9:15 AM. I showed up five hours late. They were done eating by the time I even got there.'

Keep his delivery animated and self-aware - gesturing with his hands, shaking his head at himself, like he's genuinely frustrated at his own mistake. No phone in his hands - just direct, expressive communication. Include quiet ambient truck sounds. Leave clean space in the upper-right corner so I can add a screenshot overlay later."

### Sora clip length and orientation
- Orientation: Portrait
- Length: 12 seconds
(These are set in the Sora UI, not in the prompt text.)

## Clip 3 – The Payoff: Right Time, Right Results

### Hook / continuation

"This morning? Completely different story."

### Character consistency
- **Use the same character created in Clip 1** - In Sora 2, select/reference the character from Clip 1 to maintain consistency across clips.

### Sora prompt (Clip 3)

"Vertical selfie video filmed on a phone. Same fisherman, now on his boat at dawn (soft, golden early morning light), holding a nice walleye with both hands. He looks energized and satisfied. It should feel like real TikTok UGC: slight phone shake, natural dawn lighting, phone-mic audio.

He actively speaks to camera with genuine excitement and says: 'This morning? Completely different story. Showed up at 7 AM, caught this at 7:38. Right in the middle of the window.'

Keep his delivery excited but concise - genuine satisfaction from learning the lesson. Include water sounds and morning bird calls. Leave clean space in the upper-right corner so I can add a screenshot overlay later."

### Sora clip length and orientation
- Orientation: Portrait
- Length: 10 seconds
(These are set in the Sora UI, not in the prompt text.)

## Clip 4 – AI Transparency & Call to Action

### Hook / continuation

"Oh, and full transparency..."

### Character consistency
- **Use the same character created in Clip 1** - In Sora 2, select/reference the character from Clip 1 to maintain consistency across clips.

### Sora prompt (Clip 4)

"Vertical selfie video filmed on a phone. Same fisherman, still on his boat at dawn with the walleye visible nearby (on the boat deck or in a livewell). He speaks directly to camera with a transparent, honest tone. It should feel like real TikTok UGC: slight phone shake, natural dawn lighting, phone-mic audio.

He actively speaks to camera and says: 'Oh, and full transparency—we use AI to make these videos, but the PrimeBite data? That's 100% real. Try it yourself.'

Keep his delivery genuine and transparent, like he's being honest with a friend. Include ambient water sounds. Leave clean space in the upper-right corner."

## Overlay / screenshot notes (CapCut)

**Clip 1 (0-15s):** No overlay - let the frustration and boredom land first

**Clip 2 (15-27s):** 
- Use Today Tab bite-window screenshot (Screenshot #1 from reference)
- Crop to show the morning bite window (7:15-9:15 AM example with good rating)
- Size: ~30-35% of screen width (slightly larger since this is the "reveal" moment)
- Position: top-right corner
- Show from 18s to 26s (when he mentions "7:15 to 9:15 AM" and talks about being late)
- Fade in at 18s (0.3s), fade out at 26s (0.3s)
- Optional: Add subtle red circle or arrow pointing to the morning window time to emphasize the contrast

**Clip 3 (27-37s):** 
- Brief flash of the same screenshot OR text overlay instead
- Option A: Show screenshot again from 30s to 35s with "7:38 AM" highlighted
- Option B: Simple text overlay "7:38 AM = Right in the window ✓" at bottom of screen from 30s to 36s
- Keep it minimal - the fish is the star of this clip

**Clip 4 (37-47s):** 
- No overlay needed - let the transparency message be clear and uncluttered
- Alternatively: Small text overlay at bottom "Real data • AI video" from 40s to 45s (optional, only if it feels natural)

**Total video length:** 47 seconds (15s + 12s + 10s + 10s)

## Performance notes

(To be filled in later in analytics/shorts-log.csv once view/like data is available.)

**Testing focus:** This script tests a **confession/contrast format** that should be more emotionally engaging than straight educational tips. The four-clip structure (mistake → realization → success → transparency) creates narrative tension and payoff while keeping each clip's dialogue manageable.

**AI Acknowledgment:** Clip 4 is dedicated to AI transparency, keeping the message clear and preventing dialogue from being cut off. This approach:
1. Separates the success moment (Clip 3) from the transparency message (Clip 4)
2. Ensures the AI acknowledgment isn't rushed or cut off
3. Allows each clip to stay within the 10-15 second limit
4. Emphasizes that the PrimeBite data is 100% real

**Creative elements that make this unique:**
1. **Visual contrast:** Harsh afternoon light (wrong time) vs warm dawn light (right time)
2. **Emotional arc:** Frustration → realization → satisfaction
3. **Confession format:** More relatable than "expert giving tips"
4. **Before/after structure:** But with clearer cause-and-effect (timing) rather than just product testimonial
5. **Self-deprecating humor:** Makes the speaker more likable and authentic

**Key differentiators from other scripts:**
- Uses emotional storytelling instead of straightforward tips
- Shows both failure and success (contrast creates interest)
- More cinematic variety: three different times of day, four different emotional beats
- Confession format is more engaging than instruction format
- The "mistake" angle is more memorable and shareable
- Four-clip structure ensures AI transparency message is delivered clearly without rushing

**Predicted strengths:**
- Hook is strong (problem + curiosity gap: "wanna know why?")
- Contrast should maintain attention through all three clips
- Relatable mistake that many anglers have made
- Clear, visual proof of concept (no fish → fish)
- Emotional payoff at the end

**Testing hypotheses:**
- Will confession/mistake format outperform straight tips?
- Does visual contrast (time of day) increase retention?
- Is "learning from failure" more engaging than "here's what works"?

## Notes for video creator

**Visual variety is key for this script:**
- Clip 1 should feel boring and flat (intentionally less appealing)
- Clip 2 is the turning point (more intimate, realization moment)
- Clip 3 should feel rewarding and satisfying (warm light, success)
- Clip 4 keeps the warm dawn setting but focuses on transparency (honest, direct to camera)

**Color grading recommendations:**
- Clip 1: Slightly desaturated, harsh light, less appealing
- Clip 2: Neutral, realistic
- Clip 3 & 4: Warm tones, golden hour glow, more vibrant (consistent dawn setting)

This contrast will make the "right timing" payoff feel even more rewarding visually.

**Dialogue pacing:**
- Each clip now has manageable dialogue that fits comfortably within 10-15 seconds
- Clip 4 is specifically designed to prevent the AI transparency message from being rushed or cut off
