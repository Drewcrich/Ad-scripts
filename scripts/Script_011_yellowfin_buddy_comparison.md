# Script 011 – Yellowfin Tuna: My Buddy Struck Out Yesterday (Four-clip comparison story)

**Species:** Yellowfin Tuna  
**Style:** UGC "buddy comparison" story (four-clip stitched video)  
**Platforms:** TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels  
**Concept:** Concept 07 - UGC Fisherman Testimonial

**Creative Twist:** This script uses the **"my friend vs. me"** comparison format to show the power of timing. Buddy fished yesterday (bad window) and caught nothing. User fished today (good window) and crushed it. The buddy comparison makes it relatable and viral-friendly while perfectly demonstrating PrimeBite's core value: pick the right day to fish.

**Note:** This script uses four clips (15s + 10s + 15s + 10s) that will be stitched together in CapCut for a 50-second total video.

## Clip 1 – The Hook: Buddy's Bad Day

### Hook line

"My buddy went out yesterday. Six hours on the water. Not a single yellowfin."

### Sora prompt (Clip 1)

"Vertical selfie video filmed on a phone. A mid-20s to mid-30s fisherman wearing a fishing shirt and cap is on an offshore charter boat or dock with ocean in the background. He talks directly to camera with a knowing, slightly amused tone. It should feel like real TikTok UGC: slight phone shake, natural bright ocean lighting, phone-mic audio.

He actively speaks to camera and says: 'My buddy went out yesterday. Six hours on the water. Spent over eight hundred bucks on the charter. Not a single yellowfin. He texted me last night and said the fishing was dead. Everyone on the boat struck out.'

Keep his delivery conversational and empathetic but with a hint that he knows something. Include ambient ocean sounds and boat sounds. Leave clean space in the upper-right corner so I can add a screenshot overlay later."

### Sora clip length and orientation
- Orientation: Portrait

### Sora prompt (Clip 2)

"Vertical selfie video filmed on a phone. Same fisherman, now on a charter boat holding a beautiful yellowfin tuna with both hands. Ocean and boat deck visible in background. He looks satisfied and excited. It should feel like authentic TikTok UGC: slight shake, bright ocean lighting, phone-mic audio.

He actively speaks to camera with genuine excitement and says: 'I went out today. Caught this beauty and three more just like it in under two hours.'

Keep his delivery excited but not over-the-top - genuine satisfaction and success. Include ambient ocean sounds and boat activity. Leave clean space in the upper-right corner so I can add a screenshot overlay later."

## Clip 3 – The Reveal: It's All About Timing

### Hook / continuation

"So what was the difference?"

### Character consistency
- **Use the same character created in Clip 1** - In Sora 2, select/reference the character from Clip 1 to maintain consistency across clips.

### Sora prompt (Clip 3)

"Vertical selfie video filmed on a phone. Same fisherman, still on the charter boat with ocean in background. He leans in slightly toward camera with a knowing, educational tone. It should feel like authentic TikTok UGC: slight shake, natural ocean lighting, phone-mic audio.

He actively speaks to camera and says: 'So what was the difference? I checked PrimeBite before I booked my trip. New moon to first quarter - that's when yellowfin are most active. He just picked a random day that worked for his schedule. Same boat. Same captain. Same bait. Different day. Timing is literally everything.'

Keep his delivery educational and matter-of-fact, like he's sharing valuable knowledge. Include ambient ocean sounds. Leave clean space in the upper-right corner so I can add a screenshot overlay later."

"Oh, and real quick..."

### Character consistency

### Sora prompt (Clip 4)

"Vertical selfie video filmed on a phone. Same fisherman, still on the charter boat with ocean in background. He speaks directly to camera with a transparent, honest tone. It should feel like real TikTok UGC: slight shake, natural ocean lighting, phone-mic audio.

He actively speaks to camera and says: 'Oh, and real quick - we use AI to make these videos, but PrimeBite is 100% real. Research-backed bite windows. My buddy's downloading it right now.'

Keep his delivery genuine and straightforward with a slight smile at the end. Include ambient ocean sounds. Leave clean space in the upper-right corner."

## Overlay / screenshot notes (CapCut)

**Clip 1 (0-15s):** 
- OPTIONAL: Create a fake text message screenshot showing buddy's complaint (e.g., "Dude fishing was DEAD today. 6 hours, nothing. So frustrating 😤")

- Show from 5s to 12s (when he mentions "He texted me last night")
- Fade in at 5s (0.3s), fade out at 12s (0.3s)
- Alternative: Skip text overlay entirely and let the story land through dialogue only

**Clip 2 (15-25s):** 
- No overlay - let the fish and success be the star

**Clip 3 (25-40s):** 
- Use Today Tab bite-window screenshot OR Moon Phase calendar view
- Crop to show yellowfin window or moon phase indicator (New Moon → First Quarter highlighted)
- Size: ~30-35% of screen width

## Performance notes

(To be filled in later in analytics/shorts-log.csv once view/like data is available.)

**Testing focus:** This script tests the **"buddy comparison"** format which is highly viral on TikTok/social media. The "my friend vs. me" angle is relatable and shareable. The logic is sound: two different fishing trips on different days with different bite windows.

**Creative elements that make this unique:**
1. **Buddy comparison format:** "My friend vs. me" is proven viral format
2. **Empathy then success:** Start with buddy's failure, then show your success (emotional contrast)
3. **Clear cause-and-effect:** Different days = different results (perfectly demonstrates PrimeBite value)
4. **Social proof:** "He's downloading it now" validates the app's worth
5. **Relatable pain point:** Everyone's had a bad fishing trip or knows someone who has
6. **Tag-worthy:** People will tag fishing buddies who never check conditions

**Key differentiators from other scripts:**
- First "comparison" narrative (vs. solo stories)
- Builds empathy before showing success (not bragging, just smart planning)
- Offshore/saltwater yellowfin content (vs. freshwater)
- Social validation through buddy's experience
- Clear demonstration of app's core value: pick the RIGHT DAY

**AI Acknowledgment:**
- Clip 4 dedicated to transparency
- Includes social proof: "My buddy's downloading it right now"
- Short and straightforward, won't get cut off

**Predicted strengths:**
- Strong hook: Buddy's expensive failure creates immediate interest
- Emotional contrast: Failure → success keeps attention
- Clear value proposition: Don't waste money on wrong days
- Highly shareable: "My friend vs. me" format performs well on TikTok
- Social proof: Buddy downloading app validates its value
- Relatable: Everyone knows the pain of a bad fishing trip

**Testing hypotheses:**
- Will comparison format outperform solo success stories?
- Does starting with failure (not yours) create more engagement?
- Is the buddy's validation ("downloading it now") more persuasive than solo testimonial?
- Will "wasted $800" pain point drive urgency?

**Species-specific notes (Yellowfin Tuna):**
- Best moon phases: **New moon → First Quarter** (referenced in Clip 3)
- No specific time-of-day preference (all-day fishing on charter)
- Phase-only pattern (no majors/minors)
- Perfect for multi-day charter comparison narrative

**Logic check:** ✅
- Buddy fished YESTERDAY (different day, different bite window)
- User fished TODAY (different day, different bite window)
- Same location/boat/captain possible but on DIFFERENT DAYS
- Makes perfect sense with PrimeBite's value prop: pick the right day

## Notes for video creator

**Emotional tone progression:**
- Clip 1: Empathetic, slightly amused (not mocking the buddy)
- Clip 2: Excited and satisfied (genuine success)
- Clip 3: Educational and confident (sharing knowledge)
- Clip 4: Transparent and friendly (honest + social proof)

**Visual variety:**
- Clip 1: Standing on boat/dock, talking (no fish visible)
- Clip 2: Holding the yellowfin tuna (proof of success)
- Clip 3: Closer framing, more intimate (reveal moment)
- Clip 4: Direct, honest framing (transparency)

**Dialogue pacing:**
- All clips use only 10s or 15s durations (Sora FREE constraints)
- Each clip's dialogue is tight and focused
- Clip 4 transparency message is short and separated to prevent cut-offs

**Key message:**
The difference between success and failure isn't skill, luck, or gear - it's **timing**. PrimeBite helps you pick the RIGHT DAY to fish so you don't waste money on bad windows.
