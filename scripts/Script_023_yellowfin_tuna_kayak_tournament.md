## Testing Focus
This script tests:
1. **Sky Background Angle:** Avoiding water scenes (Sora struggles with water) by using clear sky background.
2. **Tournament Angle:** Adding stakes and competition context.
3. **Kayak Setting:** Unique perspective (kayak vs. boat).
4. **Regular Clips vs. Storyboard:** Testing if regular clips generate more consistently than storyboard format.

**Hypothesis:** Regular clips with sky background angle will generate more consistently than storyboard format, while tournament angle adds excitement and stakes.
