# Script 002 – Walleye Before/After PrimeBite

**Species:** Walleye  
**Style:** UGC story (no bites → results)  

## Hook line

"Spent so many nights out here just casting and praying they'd bite."

## Sora prompt

"Vertical selfie-style UGC video filmed on a phone. Same fisherman as Script 001, hoodie and beanie, on a small boat at night on a lake.

First scene: the fisherman sits in the boat holding his rod, looking frustrated. He talks straight to the camera and says: 'I've spent so many nights out here just casting and praying they'd bite.' He gives a small eye-roll and shrug.

Then a quick hard cut to a second scene on the same night: chest-mounted view or close selfie with the camera shaking as he fights a big walleye. The rod is bent hard, water splashing near the boat, reel drag screaming. He says loudly: 'Then I started checking my PrimeBite window and it got real pretty quick!'

Make the whole video feel like raw, unpolished phone footage: slight shake, natural low-light noise, no cinematic effects. Include natural audio of his voice, water, and reel drag. Leave some empty space in the top-right area during the second scene so I can add an app screenshot overlay later."
