## Clip 1 – The Confession (Inside the Hut)

**📋 PASTE FROM HERE ↓**

Vertical selfie video filmed on a phone. Inside a dark ice fishing tent. The only light comes from the glowing blue ice hole and a small warm heater light. An older fisherman (late 50s) with a gray beard, heavy winter parka, and beanie sits hunched over the hole. His breath is visible in the cold air. Authentic, moody atmosphere.

He looks up at the camera with a serious, gritty expression and says: "I've been fishing this hardwater for forty years. I used to laugh at you guys with your apps and moon phases. I called it 'gimmick fishing.'"

Low, ambient wind sound outside the tent. Subtle heater hum. The lighting is high-contrast and cinematic.

## Clip 2 – The Turning Point (The Strike)

**📋 PASTE FROM HERE ↓**

Vertical selfie video filmed on a phone. Outside on a vast frozen lake at golden hour (sunset). The same older fisherman is kneeling on the ice, intense focus, hand-lining a fish through the slushy hole. Snow is scattered on his jacket. The wind is whipping slightly.

He speaks with adrenaline in his voice, looking briefly at the lens: "But last week, the bite was dead. Zero. Out of desperation, I checked PrimeBite. It said a major window opened at 4:30. I stayed... and five minutes later, this happened."

Action is focused on him handling the line, maybe the rod tip bending towards the hole. Real UGC feel—slightly shaky, raw energy.

**Duration:** 15 seconds | **Orientation:** Portrait

## Clip 3 – The Proof & Disclosure (Payoff)

**📋 PASTE FROM HERE ↓**

Vertical selfie video filmed on a phone. Night has fallen on the ice. The fisherman is holding a massive 28-inch Walleye horizontally, illuminated by his bright headlamp against the pitch-black background. The fish's eyes reflect the light.

He smiles, a genuine 'I was wrong' grin, and says: "I don't argue with results. This video is AI-generated, but that bite window? That was 100% accurate. The science is real. If you're serious about walleye, just download PrimeBite."

Sound of wind and crunching snow.

## Testing Focus
This script tests:
1. **Visuals:** First use of "Ice Fishing" environment (high contrast, distinct look).
2. **Psychology:** "Skeptic to Believer" narrative (overcoming objections).
3. **Character:** Older, "pro" demographic to build authority.

**Hypothesis:** The "confession" angle combined with unique ice visuals will drive high retention and trust among serious anglers.
