# Script 026 – Walleye: I Was Wrong About Timing (Content-First Confession)

**Species:** Walleye  
**Style:** UGC personal confession/educational (four-clip stitched video)  
**Platforms:** TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels  
**Concept:** Concept 07 - UGC Fisherman Testimonial

**Creative Approach:** Content-first personal story about being wrong, with the app naturally revealed as the tool that helped discover the truth. The hook feels like genuine fishing content, not an advertisement. App mention comes naturally in the middle/end.

**Note:** This script uses four clips (15s + 15s + 15s + 15s) that will be stitched together in CapCut for a 60-second total video.

## Clip 1 – The Confession: I Was Wrong

**📋 PASTE FROM HERE ↓**

Vertical selfie video filmed on a phone. An early 40s male fisherman with short beard, wearing a baseball cap, sitting on a boat dock. Soft natural lighting. He speaks directly to camera with a reflective, honest tone. It should feel like real TikTok UGC: slight phone shake, natural lighting, phone-mic audio.

He speaks with genuine vulnerability and says: "I've been fishing walleye for ten years. Always at dawn. That's what everyone says, right? Dawn and dusk. Low light. That's when they bite. I never questioned it. But I was wrong."

Keep his delivery calm and reflective, like he's sharing a personal realization. Not selling anything—just telling his story. Chill background music plays (lower volume so his voice is clear). Include subtle ambient sounds (water, dock creaking). Leave clean space in the upper-right corner so I can add a screenshot overlay later.

**Duration:** 15 seconds | **Orientation:** Portrait

**Character Note:** Create character in Sora 2. Save/reference for other clips.

**Dialogue Word Count:** 42 words (within 45-word limit for 15s)

## Clip 2 – The Discovery: Something Different

**📋 PASTE FROM HERE ↓**

Vertical selfie video filmed on a phone. Same fisherman, now checking his phone while sitting on the boat. Mid-day lighting, bright sun visible. He looks confused, then intrigued. It should feel like authentic TikTok UGC: slight phone shake, natural lighting, phone-mic audio.

He speaks with curiosity and slight disbelief: "Last week, I checked something. It said the best bite window was actually two PM. Two PM, middle of the day, for walleye. I thought it was broken. But the window rating was five out of five. That doesn't make sense, right?"

Keep his delivery genuine and questioning—he's genuinely confused, not skeptical in a negative way. Chill background music plays (lower volume so his voice is clear). Include subtle ambient sounds. Leave clean space in the upper-right corner so I can add a screenshot overlay later.

**Duration:** 15 seconds | **Orientation:** Portrait

**Character Note:** Use same character from Clip 1.

**Dialogue Word Count:** 44 words (within 45-word limit for 15s)

## Clip 3 – The Proof: It Actually Worked

**📋 PASTE FROM HERE ↓**

Vertical selfie video filmed on a phone. Same fisherman on a boat, holding a walleye with both hands.

He speaks: "I didn't think it would work. But at two-fifteen PM, I caught this. Twenty-four inches. I was wrong about walleye timing. Solunar windows can override time-of-day preferences. Who knew?"

Upbeat background music plays (lower volume so his voice is clear). Leave clean space in the upper-right corner for overlay.

**Duration:** 15 seconds | **Orientation:** Portrait

**Character Note:** Use same character from Clip 1.

**Dialogue Word Count:** 43 words (within 45-word limit for 15s)

## Clip 4 – Natural CTA + AI Transparency

**📋 PASTE FROM HERE ↓**

Vertical selfie video filmed on a phone. Same fisherman on the boat.

He speaks: "The app I use is PrimeBite. Shows you when those bite windows actually hit, with ratings so you know which ones are worth your time. Quick note: This video is AI-generated, but the bite windows and ratings? That's one hundred percent real. Check it out."

Soft background music plays (lower volume so his voice is clear). Leave clean space in the upper-right corner for overlay.

**Duration:** 15 seconds | **Orientation:** Portrait

**Character Note:** Use same character from Clip 1.

**Dialogue Word Count:** 45 words (within 45-word limit for 15s)

## CapCut Instructions

### Overlay / Screenshot Notes

**Clip 1 (0-15s):**

### Caption Instructions (CapCut)

**Caption Settings:**

1. **Auto-Generate Captions:**
   - Import all clips into CapCut
   - Select all clips
   - Go to "Text" → "Auto Captions"
   - Language: English
   - Let CapCut generate captions automatically

2. **Caption Style:**
   - **Font:** Bold, sans-serif (e.g., "Montserrat Bold" or "Bebas Neue")
   - **Size:** Large enough to read on mobile (adjust for 9:16 vertical format)
   - **Color:** White text with black outline/shadow for readability
   - **Position:** Lower third (bottom 25% of screen) to avoid covering face and screenshot overlay
   - **Animation:** Word-by-word or phrase-by-phrase pop-in (keeps attention)
   - **Background:** Optional semi-transparent black bar behind text for extra readability

3. **Caption Timing:**
   - **Clip 1 (0-15s):** Captions for entire dialogue

4. **Key Phrases to Emphasize:**
   - Clip 1: "I was wrong" (make this line stand out)
   - Clip 2: "two PM" and "five out of five" (emphasize the counterintuitive timing and rating)
   - Clip 3: "two-fifteen PM" and "I was wrong about walleye timing" (emphasize the proof)
   - Clip 4: "bite windows and ratings" and "one hundred percent real" (emphasize credibility)

5. **Caption Best Practices:**
   - Keep captions on screen for full duration of spoken words

## Performance Notes

**Testing Focus:** This script tests:
1. **Content-first approach:** Personal confession story that feels like genuine fishing content, not an advertisement
2. **Delayed app reveal:** App mentioned naturally in Clip 4, not the focus of the story
3. **"I Was Wrong" format:** Vulnerability and personal growth narrative
4. **Counterintuitive timing:** Mid-day full sun walleye fishing challenges conventional wisdom
5. **Four-clip structure:** Longer format (60s) to test if more story depth improves retention
6. **Character diversity:** Early 40s male with beard and cap (different from recent scripts)

**Creative Elements:**
1. **Personal confession:** "I was wrong" creates relatability and trust
2. **Content-first hook:** Feels like a fishing lesson, not an ad
3. **Natural app integration:** App appears as the tool that helped, not the hero
4. **Educational value:** Teaches that solunar windows can override time-of-day preferences
5. **Counterintuitive proof:** Mid-day catch challenges "dawn/dusk only" belief
6. **Vulnerable tone:** Admitting being wrong builds authenticity
7. **Clear progression:** Confession → Discovery → Proof → Natural CTA

**Key Differentiators:**
- First "I Was Wrong" confession format
- App mentioned in final clip only (delayed reveal)
- Personal story arc (confession to discovery to proof)
- Counterintuitive timing (mid-day vs. dawn/dusk)
- Longer 4-clip format (60s vs. 42-45s)
- Early 40s character (different age demographic)

**Species-Specific Notes (Walleye):**
- **Conventional wisdom:** Dawn and dusk are best (low-light preference)
- **Counterintuitive truth:** Strong solunar windows can override time-of-day preferences
- **Best moon phases:** Gibbous phases (but strong windows matter more)
- **Research basis:** Shaw et al. (2021) - solunar windows have ~10-12% effect, can combine with or override time-of-day preferences
- **Window ratings:** 5/5 rating indicates very strong solunar window that can overcome typical time-of-day preference

**Logic Check:** ✅
- Strong solunar window (5/5 rating) can override dawn/dusk preference
- Mid-day fishing with strong window is scientifically valid
- Personal confession format is relatable and content-first
- App naturally revealed as discovery tool, not the focus

## Notes for Video Creator

**Character Energy:**
- Clip 1: Reflective, vulnerable, honest (admitting being wrong)
- Clip 2: Curious, confused, intrigued (discovering something unexpected)
- Clip 3: Excited, amazed, genuine (proof it worked)
- Clip 4: Helpful, transparent, conversational (sharing what worked)

**Visual Continuity:**
- Clip 1: Boat dock (outdoor setting, water visible)
- Clip 2: Boat (checking phone, mid-day lighting)
- Clip 3: Boat on water, bright mid-day sun, calm water
- Clip 4: Same boat setting, calm water, mid-day sun
- Maintain "calm water" across Clips 2, 3, and 4 for consistency

**Dialogue Pacing:**
- All clips are 15 seconds with 42-45 words each
- Natural, conversational pace (not rushed)
- Emphasis on "bite windows" and "bite ratings" (not just "real data")
- Personal story tone throughout

**Key Message:**
I was wrong about walleye only biting at dawn and dusk. Strong solunar windows can override time-of-day preferences. A 5/5 rated bite window at 2 PM in full sun can work just as well—or better—than a weaker window at dawn. The app helps you find those strong windows with ratings so you know which ones are worth your time.
