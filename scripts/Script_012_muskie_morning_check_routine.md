## Sora prompt

"Vertical selfie video filmed on a phone. A mid-20s to mid-30s fisherman wearing a hoodie and beanie is in his garage with fishing rods visible in the background. Early morning light coming through a window. It should feel like real TikTok UGC: slight phone shake, natural lighting, and phone-mic audio.

He speaks directly to the camera with quiet energy, like someone sharing a tip before heading out. He says something like: 'If you muskie fish, don't skip this one-minute check before you leave. I look at the activity chart, see when the windows actually hit, and plan my spots around that. Saves me from burning the best hours on dead water.'

Keep his delivery genuine and practical, like giving advice to a friend, not selling anything. Include subtle ambient garage sounds (maybe keys jingling, gear being moved). Leave clean space in the top-right corner so I can add a small graphic later."

## Overlay / screenshot notes (CapCut)

- Use 24-hour Timeline screenshot showing activity peaks (muskie-specific if available), cropped to show the timeline curve clearly.  
- Add as an overlay in CapCut, not in Sora.  
- Size: ~25–30% of screen width.  
- Position: top-right corner.  
- Show roughly from 5s to 10s with a short fade in/out (0.2–0.3s).  
- Optional small text near it: `activity chart` or `my 1-min check`.  
- No big "PrimeBite" logo or hard CTA on screen; this video is content-first.

## Hashtags

Example set:

`#muskie #muskiefishing #fishinglife #fishingtiktok #muskellunge #morningfishing`

## Strategy notes

- Single-clip format (like Script 005 which had 3.7% engagement rate)
- Educational/tip-based angle (proven to work)
- Different species (muskie) to diversify content
- Morning setting (vs. night) for variety
- Timeline screenshot (vs. Today Tab) to show different app feature
- "One minute" = specific, tangible value proposition
