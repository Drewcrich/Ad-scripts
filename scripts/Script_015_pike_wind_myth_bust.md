# Script 015 – Northern Pike: Why Wind Actually Helps (Three-clip myth-bust video)

**Species:** Northern Pike  
**Style:** UGC educational myth-bust (three-clip stitched video)  
**Platforms:** TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels  
**Concept:** Concept 07 - UGC Fisherman Testimonial

**Creative Twist:** This script uses **myth-busting + counterintuitive science** to teach viewers something they probably don't know: wind actually HELPS pike fishing (8-15 mph is ideal). The format is educational-first, with the app mentioned casually as a tool. The attractive, enthusiastic female angler brings fresh energy to the channel and tests whether character diversity improves performance.

**Note:** This script uses three clips (15s + 12s + 15s) that will be stitched together in CapCut for a 42-second total video.

## Clip 1 – The Hook: Myth-Busting Setup

### Hook line

"Everyone cancels their pike trip when it's windy. That's actually the best time to go."

### Sora prompt (Clip 1)

**📋 PASTE FROM HERE ↓**

Vertical selfie video filmed on a phone. A mid-30s female angler with long hair (pulled back in a ponytail or loose under a baseball cap) is standing on a dock or boat launch with a lake in the background. She's wearing a casual fishing shirt or hoodie. The wind is visibly blowing (hair moving, ripples on water). She has an energetic, confident smile and speaks directly to camera with enthusiasm. It should feel like real TikTok UGC: slight phone shake, natural outdoor lighting, phone-mic audio with wind noise.

She speaks to camera with a knowing, slightly playful tone and says: 'Everyone cancels their pike trip when it's windy. I get it—it's annoying to cast, your line blows everywhere. But that's actually the best time to go. Pike love wind. Like, they genuinely hunt better when there's chop on the water.'

Keep her delivery energetic and engaging—lots of natural smiling, animated facial expressions, like she's genuinely excited to share this tip. She gestures with her free hand while talking. Include ambient wind sounds and water sounds. Leave clean space in the upper-right corner so I can add a screenshot overlay later.

## Clip 2 – The Science: Why Wind Helps Pike

### Hook / continuation

"Here's why: pike are ambush predators..."

### Character consistency
- **Use the same character created in Clip 1** - In Sora 2, select/reference the character from Clip 1 to maintain consistency across clips.

### Sora prompt (Clip 2)

**📋 PASTE FROM HERE ↓**

Vertical selfie video filmed on a phone. Same female angler, now on a small boat or kayak on the water. The wind is creating visible surface chop (small waves, ripples). She's still smiling and engaged, speaking directly to camera with educational enthusiasm. It should feel like authentic TikTok UGC: slight phone shake, natural lighting, phone-mic audio with wind and water sounds.

She leans in slightly toward camera and speaks with a teaching tone, still energetic and smiling: 'Here's why: pike are ambush predators. They hide in weeds and strike fast. When there's wind, it creates chop on the surface—breaks up the light, makes it harder for baitfish to see them coming. It's like hunting with camouflage. Eight to fifteen miles per hour? That's the sweet spot.'

Keep her delivery educational but still fun and engaging—she's teaching something cool, not lecturing. Natural hand gestures, genuine smile. Include wind and water sounds. Leave clean space in the upper-right corner so I can add a screenshot overlay later.

## Clip 3 – The Payoff: Proof + AI Transparency

### Hook / continuation

"So I checked the wind forecast, went out at 12 miles per hour..."

### Character consistency
- **Use the same character created in Clip 1** - In Sora 2, select/reference the character from Clip 1 to maintain consistency across clips.

### Sora prompt (Clip 3)

**📋 PASTE FROM HERE ↓**

Vertical selfie video filmed on a phone. Same female angler, still on the boat or kayak, now holding a nice northern pike with both hands. She's beaming—genuine excitement and satisfaction. The wind is still visible (chop on water, hair moving). It should feel like authentic TikTok UGC: slight phone shake, natural lighting, phone-mic audio.

She actively speaks to camera with excitement and says: 'So I checked the wind forecast, went out at twelve miles per hour, and look—this girl crushed it right in the chop. Oh, and real quick—yeah, we use AI to make these videos, but the PrimeBite data and research? That's 100% real. The app shows you exactly how wind affects pike, full research document, technical appendix, all the sources. It's all there. Try it yourself.'

Keep her delivery excited and genuine in the first half (showing the fish), then shift to transparent and straightforward for the AI acknowledgment—not defensive, just honest and matter-of-fact. Lots of smiling throughout. Include ambient wind and water sounds. Leave clean space in the upper-right corner so I can add a screenshot overlay later.

**Clip 2 (15-27s):** 
- Use Weather Tab screenshot showing wind conditions (Screenshot #7 from reference)
- Crop to show wind speed (ideally 8-15 mph range) and "Fishing Impact" section that says "Moderate wind helps Pike activity"
- Size: ~30-35% of screen width
- Position: top-right corner
- Show from 20s to 26s (when she mentions "eight to fifteen miles per hour" and explains the science)
- Fade in at 20s (0.3s), fade out at 26s (0.3s)
- Optional: Add small text annotation "8-15 mph = Pike sweet spot" near screenshot

**Clip 3 (27-42s):** 
- Use Research & Sources screenshot (Screenshot #5 from reference) OR Technical Appendix (Screenshot #6)

## Performance notes

(To be filled in later in analytics/shorts-log.csv once view/like data is available.)

**Testing focus:** This script tests:
1. **Character diversity:** Mid-30s female angler vs. male-heavy previous scripts
2. **Myth-busting format:** Counterintuitive science vs. straightforward tips
3. **3-clip format:** Shorter total length (42s vs. 47-50s) to see if retention improves
4. **Educational-first approach:** Science and practical value BEFORE app mention
5. **Captions:** First script with full captions to test accessibility and engagement

**Creative elements that make this unique:**
1. **Counterintuitive science:** Wind = good for pike (opposite of what most anglers think)
2. **Myth-busting format:** Challenges common belief, creates curiosity
3. **Female angler:** Diversifies channel, tests whether gender affects performance
4. **Energetic delivery:** Lots of smiling, enthusiasm, genuine excitement
5. **Educational value:** Teaches WHY wind helps (ambush predator behavior, surface chop)
6. **Research-backed:** Kuparinen et al. (2010) - real peer-reviewed study
7. **Practical tip:** Specific wind speed range (8-15 mph)
8. **Integrated AI transparency:** Built into Clip 3 payoff, not separate clip

**Key differentiators from other scripts:**
- First myth-busting format (vs. tips, confessions, comparisons)
- First female angler character
- Counterintuitive science (wind = good, not bad)
- Shorter 3-clip format (vs. 4-clip in Scripts 010-011)
- AI transparency integrated into payoff clip (more efficient)
- First script with full caption instructions

**Predicted strengths:**
- Hook is strong and counterintuitive ("windy = best time")
- Educational value is high (teaches real science)
- Character diversity may attract broader audience
- Energetic, smiling delivery should increase likability
- Practical tip is immediately actionable
- Myth-busting format is memorable and shareable
- Captions improve accessibility and retention

**Testing hypotheses:**
- Will female angler outperform male-heavy scripts?
- Does myth-busting format drive more engagement than tips?
- Is 3-clip format (42s) better for retention than 4-clip (47-50s)?
- Do captions improve watch time and completion rate?
- Does counterintuitive science create more shares/comments?

**Species-specific notes (Northern Pike):**
- **Best wind conditions:** 8-15 mph (moderate wind, creates surface chop)
- **Why wind helps:** Pike are ambush predators; chop breaks up light, reduces baitfish visibility
- **Best time of day:** Dusk (strongest tendency, mentioned in research but not in this script—could be future script)
- **Research source:** Kuparinen et al. (2010) - wind positive for pike, ~19.2% deviance explained

**Logic check:** ✅
- Wind creates surface chop → breaks up light → helps pike ambush prey
- 8-15 mph is the "sweet spot" (per research)
- Pike are the ONLY species with positive wind model (unique selling point)
- Weather Tab screenshot shows "Moderate wind helps Pike activity" (matches dialogue)

## Notes for video creator

**Character energy is key:**
- This character should feel energetic, enthusiastic, and genuinely excited about fishing
- Lots of natural smiling (not forced or overly posed)
- Animated facial expressions and hand gestures
- Approachable and attractive, but authentic angler vibe (not model-like or overly glamorous)
- Confident body language—she knows what she's talking about

**Visual elements:**
- Wind should be VISIBLE in all three clips (hair moving, water chop, ripples)
- Clip 1: Standing on dock/launch, wind blowing, energetic setup
- Clip 2: On water, visible chop, teaching moment
- Clip 3: Holding pike, still windy, excited payoff + transparency

**Dialogue pacing:**
- Clip 1 (15s): Hook + myth-bust + explanation (tight but manageable)
- Clip 2 (12s): Science explanation (focused, educational)
- Clip 3 (15s): Payoff + AI transparency (integrated, not rushed)

**Color grading recommendations:**
- Natural, vibrant outdoor colors
- Enhance the blue/green tones of water
- Keep skin tones natural and flattering
- Slightly increase contrast to make wind/chop more visible

**Audio notes:**
- Wind noise should be present but not overwhelming
- Her voice should be clear and audible over wind
- Water sounds add authenticity
- Natural, unpolished audio (TikTok UGC vibe)

**Key message:**
Don't cancel your pike trip when it's windy—that's actually when pike hunt best. Wind creates surface chop that helps them ambush prey. 8-15 mph is the sweet spot. Check the wind forecast and use it to your advantage.
