## Clip 1 – The Hook (Catchy Opening)

**📋 PASTE FROM HERE ↓**

Vertical handheld video. Night/dusk on a rocky cove shoreline. Trees in background, slightly run-down beach feel. A small campfire glows nearby. Three fishermen in hoodies and jackets, windy conditions (hair/clothing moving). One guy's rod suddenly bends hard. He yells "FISH ON!" 

The main fisherman (filming) turns to camera with excited energy: "Everyone else went home because of the wind. We stayed. PrimeBite said the major window opened at 7 PM. It's 7:02. Look at this!"

Raw UGC feel: shaky camera, natural lighting from fire and headlamps, phone-mic audio. Leave space in upper-right corner for overlay.

The other two guys are moving quickly, one holding a landing net ready. Windy conditions (hair/clothing moving). Chaotic, excited energy.

The main fisherman (filming) pans between the rod and his buddies: "Get the net! Get the net! This thing is pulling HARD!"

Raw UGC feel: shaky, natural lighting from fire and headlamps, excited voices. Leave space in upper-right corner for overlay.

## Clip 3 – The Payoff (Celebration)

Vertical handheld video. Same rocky cove shoreline. Same trees, same campfire glowing. Same night/dusk lighting. The main fisherman holds a massive 40-inch Pike horizontally with both hands. It's huge. His buddies are celebrating in the background, high-fiving, hyped.

He speaks directly to camera with pure excitement: "Forty inches! The app said 7 PM major window. We caught it at 7:08. Eight minutes into the window. This is NOT a coincidence."

Raw, authentic UGC energy. "We just caught the fish of the year!" vibe. Leave space in upper-right corner for overlay.

## Clip 4 – High-Energy CTA (Multiple Screenshots)

**📋 PASTE FROM HERE ↓**

Vertical handheld video. Same rocky cove shoreline. Same campfire glowing in background. Same night/dusk lighting. The main fisherman speaks directly to camera with high energy and confidence: "Quick note: This video is AI-generated, but PrimeBite's bite windows? That's 100% real. The app shows you exactly when fish are going to bite—all backed by peer-reviewed research. It tells you bite windows, rates how good they are, and shows you the science behind it. Download PrimeBite on the App Store."

Upbeat, driving background music plays (lower volume so his voice is clear). He gestures naturally while speaking. High-energy, confident delivery.

<summary>📊 Analytics & Testing Notes</summary>

## Testing Focus
This script tests:
1. **High-Energy CTA:** Multiple screenshots with strong audio (voiceover + music) to maintain engagement.
2. **Shoreline Setting:** Rocky cove/beach environment (different from boat/ice/truck settings).
3. **Group Energy:** 3-4 people, chaotic celebration (similar to Script 007's success).
4. **Pike Species:** Testing pike content (wind-positive angle is unique).

**Hypothesis:** The high-energy CTA with rotating screenshots + strong audio will drive downloads while maintaining transparency. Shoreline setting provides visual variety.
