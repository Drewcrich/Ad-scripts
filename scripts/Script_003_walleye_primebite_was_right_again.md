# Script 003 – Walleye Testimonial ("PrimeBite was right again")

**Species:** Walleye  
**Style:** UGC testimonial  

## Hook line

"PrimeBite was right again. Look at this."

## Sora prompt

"Vertical selfie video filmed on a phone. Same mid-20s to mid-30s fisherman in hoodie and beanie talks directly into the camera in his boat at dusk. It should feel like raw TikTok UGC: slight phone shake, natural lighting, natural phone-mic sound.

He starts the video excited and says something like: 'PrimeBite was right again. Look at this.'

Then cut to him holding a big walleye close to the camera with both hands, hyped, showing the fish's size. He says: 'Same window it called. I'm not even kidding.'

Cut back to the selfie shot for a final short line such as: 'If you fish walleye, check your window before you go.'

Keep the delivery natural and energetic. Include light boat/water ambience during the fish shot. Leave clean space in the top-right during the final selfie shot so I can add an app screenshot overlay later."
