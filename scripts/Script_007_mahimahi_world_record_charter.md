## Clip 1 – The Hook & Setup

### Sora prompt (Clip 1)

"Vertical selfie video on a charter boat with 4-5 excited people. Raw UGC feel. Fisherman talks to camera while pointing back at someone fighting a fish: 'Bro, this is NOT a normal mahi. Look at the bend in that rod! We checked PrimeBite this morning and it said the bite window was going to be insane from 10 to noon, so we're out here and—' Someone yells 'HOLY S***!' behind him. 

People are pointing and reacting to the fight happening behind the camera. Hyped, chaotic energy but the fish is NOT visible yet. Leave space in upper-right corner for overlay."

### Sora prompt (Clip 2)

"Vertical video on a charter boat with 6-7 people. Raw UGC feel. Same fisherman filming over the shoulder of someone fighting a fish - the rod is bent hard, line going out into the water. 

He talks to camera: 'Guys, I think this might actually be world record size. We've been out here four hours, and this thing has been on for twenty minutes straight. The captain's saying he's never seen one pull like this.'

People watching the bent rod, talking excitedly, some filming. The fish is still deep in the water, NOT visible yet. Electric energy. Leave space in upper-right corner for overlay."

### Sora prompt (Clip 3)

"Vertical video on a charter boat deck. Raw UGC feel, very shaky camera. A massive mahi-mahi just landed on the boat deck - over 5 feet long, brilliantly colored (electric blue, yellow, green), flopping on deck. 8-9 people crowded around it, everyone filming with phones, pointing, absolutely losing their minds.

Same fisherman filming yells: 'THERE IT IS! Look at the SIZE of that thing! That's gotta be eighty pounds, EASY!'

Everyone screaming - 'Oh my GOD!', 'Are you recording this?!', 'LOOK AT THAT BULL!' Chaotic, explosive energy. Leave space in upper-right corner for overlay."

### Character consistency

### Sora prompt (Clip 4)

"Vertical video on a charter boat. Raw UGC feel. Same fisherman holding a massive mahi-mahi horizontally with both hands - one hand under the head, one hand under the tail. The fish is heavy and long, stretched out in front of him. He's talking directly to camera. 2-3 people in background doing natural boat stuff.

He actively speaks to camera: 'Eighty-seven pounds. I'm not even kidding. And it hit at 10:42 AM, right in the middle of the window PrimeBite told us. I've been using this app for six months, but THIS... this is insane.'

Relaxed, post-catch vibe. Leave space in upper-right corner for overlay."

## Performance notes

(To be filled in later in analytics/shorts-log.csv once view/like data is available.)

**Testing focus:** This script tests several new elements:
1. **Species diversity:** First non-walleye content (offshore vs. freshwater)
2. **Energy level:** Extremely high energy, exuberant, chaotic celebration
3. **Multiple people:** Crowd/group dynamic vs. solo fisherman
4. **Epic moment style:** World record size catch vs. educational tip format
5. **Longer format:** 4-clip stitch (~55 seconds total) vs. previous 2-3 clip scripts
6. **Tournament/charter setting:** Different environment from solo lake fishing

**Hypothesis:** Epic, high-energy moments with multiple people and massive fish may drive shares and engagement through excitement factor, even if avg watch time is lower than educational content. This tests whether "viral moment" style performs better than "educational tip" style for offshore/charter content.
