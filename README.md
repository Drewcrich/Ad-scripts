## 🚀 How to Use This with Claude

### For Creating New Scripts:

1. **Read `AI_GUIDE.md` first** - Contains all rules, templates, and best practices
2. **Check `analytics/shorts-log.csv`** - See what's working (top performers)
3. **Review top-performing scripts** - Learn from what works
4. **Use the template in `AI_GUIDE.md`** - Follow the structure exactly
5. **Keep prompts SIMPLE** - Over-detailing breaks Sora 2 (see AI_GUIDE.md)

### Key Files to Reference:

- **`AI_GUIDE.md`** - Your main reference (read this first!)
- **`WORKFLOW.md`** - Quick workflow reminder
- **`RESEARCH_HUB.md`** - Species-specific fishing science
- **`concepts/High_Potential_Formats.md`** - Formats to test for viral potential

## 📊 What Makes Scripts Viral

Based on analytics, top-performing scripts have:
- **Content-first approach** (feels like fishing content, not ads)
- **Educational value** (tips, myth-busting, lessons learned)
- **Relatable stories** (personal confessions, routines, mistakes)
- **Visual proof** (fish shots, timing accuracy)
- **Strong hooks** (pattern interrupts, curiosity gaps)

**Top Performers:**
- Script 014: 1,936 views (truck cab routine)
- Script 004: 1,611 views (night routine)
- Script 015: 1,117 views (pike wind myth-bust)

## 🎬 Script Creation Rules (Critical)

1. **Clip durations: ONLY 10s or 15s** (Sora 2 limitation)
2. **Always include background music** in every prompt
3. **Dialogue limits:** 25-30 words (10s), 35-45 words (15s)
4. **Keep prompts SIMPLE** - Let Sora fill in details naturally
5. **Fish on deck only** - Never show fish in water
6. **AI transparency** - Always include disclosure
7. **Content-first** - Hook should feel like fishing content, not an ad

**See `AI_GUIDE.md` for complete rules and examples.**

## 📝 Creating Script 27+

When creating a new script:

1. Read `AI_GUIDE.md` (all rules and template)
2. Check `analytics/shorts-log.csv` (what's working)
3. Review top 3 performing scripts
4. Choose a format from `High_Potential_Formats.md` or proven formats
5. Follow the template in `AI_GUIDE.md`
6. **Keep prompts simple** - Over-detailing causes Sora failures
7. Include CapCut instructions and title/caption

**Example command for Claude:**
```
"Create Script 27 using the template and analytics data. 
Use the Split-Screen Comparison format from High_Potential_Formats.md 
with Walleye species."
```
